//! In-process **hot-inject** prototype (M-341; ADR-017; ADR-016's call ABI; RFC-0004 §9 the
//! interpreted↔compiled continuum; phase-4).
//!
//! This is the *named first build step* of ADR-017, realized on the M-340 `dlopen` JIT (the
//! prototype substrate). It builds the three pieces ADR-016/017 specify:
//!
//! 1. **A hash-keyed dispatch table** ([`Image`]) — the running image holds a `ContentHash → entry`
//!    map (ADR-016's call ABI: a compiled stable component is invoked by the *content hash of the
//!    definition* it compiles). A [`call`](Image::call) **resolves to a compiled entry if present,
//!    else interprets** the definition (the continuum, RFC-0004 §9.1). A hash with neither a
//!    compiled entry nor an interpretable definition is an **explicit** [`InjectError::DispatchMiss`]
//!    — never a silent guess (G2/SC-3; ADR-017 decision 5).
//! 2. **Load-and-register injection** ([`inject`](Image::inject)) — "injecting" a recompiled
//!    definition compiles its unit (the `dlopen` JIT) and registers a *new* `hash → entry`. It
//!    **never mutates a live entry**: because identity *is* the content hash (ADR-003), a re-inject
//!    of the same definition is the same code under the same key (publish-once, idempotent), and an
//!    *edited* definition is a **new hash under a new entry** (ADR-017 decision 4). The atomicity
//!    hazard dissolves: an in-flight call to the old hash finishes on the old (still-loaded) code,
//!    while a new caller — referencing the new hash — dispatches to the new entry.
//! 3. **The recompile set by hash reachability** ([`recompile_closure`]) — editing a definition
//!    yields a new hash; its transitive *dependents* (which named the old hash) get new hashes too;
//!    everything else keeps its hash *and its already-compiled entry*. So the recompile set is
//!    **exactly the changed dependency-closure**, computed by reachability over the dependency graph
//!    — no AST/file diff (ADR-017 decision 3).
//!
//! **Verification (NFR-7).** The injected-compiled path is checked **observationally equivalent** to
//! the reference interpreter through the shared M-210 TV checker (`mycelium_cert::check`,
//! `ObservationalEquiv`) — the same checker that validates swaps and the interp↔AOT differential.
//! See `tests/inject_hotswap.rs`.
//!
//! **Scope / honesty (VR-5).** This is the *in-process* proof. A "definition/unit" here is a
//! **closed** bit/trit-subset program (the JIT's domain today, M-340) and the call boundary is
//! ADR-016's call ABI **restricted to nullary units** — the args-carrying value boundary (the
//! RFC-0001 §4.8 wire form) lands with the MLIR→LLVM backend (RFC-0004 §2). Cross-process / native
//! units and the cross-process unit format (RFC-0004 §10 OQ-3) stay deferred. What is proven *now*:
//! hash-keyed dispatch, never-silent resolution, load-and-register injection without live-entry
//! mutation, the dependency-closure recompile set, and interp≡injected-compiled equivalence.
//!
//! **Submodule confinement (DN-21 §5 F-2):** zero `unsafe` — compiler-enforced; the crate's
//! only `unsafe` is the dynamic-linking FFI in `jit`/`bitnet`/`specialize`.
