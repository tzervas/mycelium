//! The **`ErrorBound` (ε) kernel** — affine arithmetic (M-201; ADR-010 §1; RFC-0001 §4.7).
//!
//! ε-magnitude bounds compose through **affine arithmetic** (the ADR-010 §1 choice — sound,
//! compositional, *correlation-aware*; the Daisy/Rosa + FloVer lineage). The semantic domain is the
//! [`AffineForm`] `x̂ = x₀ + Σ xᵢ·εᵢ` over noise symbols `εᵢ ∈ [−1, +1]`; its **radius** `Σ|xᵢ|` is the
//! sound ε on the deviation from the central value. Linear ops (`add`/`sub`/`neg`/`scale`) are exact
//! in their *algebraic structure* (shared noise symbols cancel — the correlation awareness); `mul` is
//! nonlinear, so its second-order remainder is over-approximated onto a fresh noise symbol.
//!
//! **The compositions are computed in f64, and a `Proven` ε that travels in a bound must be a *true*
//! upper bound** — so every bound-increasing quantity is rounded **outward** (the [`crate::round`]
//! helpers), and each operation folds the magnitude of its own floating-point round-off into the
//! reserved [`ROUNDOFF_SYM`] term so [`AffineForm::radius`] stays a sound enclosure under f64
//! arithmetic (WS1; A2-01). An operation that is exact in f64 (e.g. integer sums, power-of-two
//! scales) adds no round-off term, so an exact composition stays exact.
//!
//! The scalar [`ErrorBound`] `{eps, norm}` is the projection that travels in a [`mycelium_core::Bound`]
//! (`BoundKind::Error`). Its compositions are the *conservative* (worst-case, correlation-free)
//! projections used when only the magnitudes — not the affine structure — are available (the
//! interpreter's case, M-204), likewise outward-rounded. All three normative composition properties
//! hold: **Soundness** (the composed `eps` is a true upper bound on the deviation, including f64
//! round-off), **Monotonicity** (never tighter than the inputs justify), **Determinism** (identical
//! inputs → identical `eps`).
