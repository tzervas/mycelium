//! `mycelium-cli` — the **`myc`** one-command toolchain driver (M-733; E16-1).
//!
//! A single front door over the Mycelium toolchain: `myc init` scaffolds a phylum, `myc build`
//! packages it (the content-addressed spore — M-368), `myc check` type-checks it (parse + check via
//! the L1 front-end), `myc test` runs the available verification, `myc run` executes a project
//! (single- or **multi-nodule**, M-908/M-909) through the reference interpreter, and `myc --stream`
//! parses a `;`-delimited component stream from stdin or a file (M-820 / DN-57).
//!
//! ## Error-message quality bar (DN-22 / RFC-0013)
//! Every user-visible failure is a structured [`Report`]: a stable `code`, a human-readable
//! `message`, an optional source `location`, and an actionable `help`. No raw Rust panic ever
//! reaches the user (G2 — never opaque); a failure the driver cannot honestly act on is reported as
//! such, never swallowed and never faked (VR-5).
//!
//! ## Honesty about scope (`Declared`)
//! `init` / `build` / `check` do real end-to-end work. `test` runs `check` and is explicit that a
//! dedicated `.myc` unit-test *runner* does not exist yet (it does not pretend to have run tests
//! that were never written). `run` executes a project's `.myc` sources: a **single** source follows
//! the M-908 v0 path (parse → [`check_nodule`] → [`elaborate`](mycelium_l1::elaborate) its nullary
//! `main`); **two or more** sources follow the M-909 multi-nodule path (see [`run`]'s doc for the
//! full linking model). A missing `main`, a program outside the evaluation-complete fragment, or an
//! interpreter failure are each an explicit [`Report`] — never a silent narrowing to "the first file
//! found" and never a stub that pretends to have run (G2/VR-5). `--stream` is a **token-driven**
//! component splitter: it lexes the source once ([`mycelium_l1::lexer::lex`]), segments the token
//! stream at `nodule` header tokens (`;` as `Tok::Semi` is the per-item terminator — DN-57), and
//! parse each component slice with [`mycelium_l1::parse`]. Splitting on *tokens* (not raw text) makes
//! it comment-/string-safe by construction: a `nodule`/`;` inside a `//` comment is never a token, so
//! it can never mis-split (DN-57 §2). The per-component parse bounds parse state to one component at
//! a time. **v0 I/O is whole-input-buffered** (`Declared`); true per-`;`-component incremental I/O
//! would require a resumable L1 token-stream API that does not exist yet (flagged future work).

/// *I/O* is fully buffered. True per-`;`-component **incremental** I/O would require the L1 lexer to
/// expose a resumable/incremental token-stream API (one does not exist yet); that is flagged as
/// future work (`Declared`). The *split* itself is `Empirical` — it is token-accurate (see below)
/// and tested, including comment-/string-safety.

/// ([`Tok::Semi`](mycelium_l1::token::Tok::Semi)) items, up to (but not including) the next `nodule`
/// header token. Crucially this is **not** a raw-text keyword scan: a `nodule` or `;` appearing
/// inside a `//` comment (or a future string literal) is **not** a `Tok::Nodule`/`Tok::Semi` token,
/// so it can never cause a mis-split (DN-57 §2: "the end-of-component is a *token*, not the *absence*
/// of more tokens" — a streaming parser must not scan ahead for the next item-opening *keyword text*).
///
/// ## Never-silent error contract (G2)
/// - A **lex** failure surfaces as an outer `Err(Report)` (`myc-stream-lex`) with the source
///   position — a lexically invalid stream is never silently truncated.
/// - A malformed component yields a [`Report`] (`myc-stream-parse`) with the 1-based component
///   index, the parse-error position within that component, and an actionable `help:` line. The
///   remaining components are still attempted — one bad component does not abort the stream.
/// - A component whose last token before the next `nodule`/EOF is **not** `Tok::Semi` is an
///   unterminated component: an explicit `myc-stream-eof` error (DN-57 §3.1 — mandatory `;`), never
///   a silent partial accept.
/// - An entirely empty stream (no tokens) or one with no `nodule` header is an explicit
