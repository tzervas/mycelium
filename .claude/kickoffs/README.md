# Kickoffs — tiered `dev → integration → main` workflow

Development runs on a **three-tier branch model** with a **stringency gradient** — messy below,
polished on top — plus **stowed kickoffs** (one per isolated-tree work package) so multiple
**Sonnet swarms** run in parallel across **disjoint crates/directories**, collision-free by
construction (CLAUDE.md §Swarm).

> **The top-level of this directory holds only *current* kickoffs.** Completed kickoffs are moved to
> [`archive/`](archive/) once their tranche has landed on `main` and been validated against the
> codebase (the audit that produced this list, 2026-06-28). See **§Completed (archived)** below.
>
> **Recent landings (2026-06-29 → 06-30, on `main`).** The serial-language closeout — tuple type +

> (M-825) — **resolved the `s10`/`hof` flagged residuals** (or-patterns, tuple-gated partial app).
> The **DN-64 §7** design wave also landed: **RFC-0038 Inject-Mode Security Axis → `Accepted`**
> (design ratified, mechanism unbuilt → claims stay `Declared` until Enacted), **DN-65** scoped-PR /
> toolchain-scoping workflow policy, `research/26`+`27`, and the VSA proof-discovery experiment
> (M-827…M-849). These are design-phase landings, **not** 1.0.0-track kickoffs — the track table
> below is unchanged by them (only the `s10`/`hof` residual notes are refreshed).
>
> **Workspace prep + scoped PRs (DN-65).** At kickoff, every agent **syncs off the latest tip**
> (same head, tips match) and **pre-installs the toolchain its work-package needs** (Rust →
> `just setup`; Python → `uv sync`; docs → markdown/`doc_refs`; proofs → `z3`/LH/Lean) before
> working. Land each work-package as **logical, closely-scoped PRs** (~1–2k-LOC soft target,

## The tiers (each PR-gated; stringency rises with the tier)

```
feature/leaf  ──PR──▶  dev  ──PR──▶  integration  ──squash-PR──▶  main
 (isolated tree)      (messy OK)      (full gate)                (polished · released)
```

| Branch | Tier | Bar to land here (via PR) | Merge style |
|---|---|---|---|
| **`main`** | release | the **full** `just check` + `/pr-review` + a **curated squash** — the clean, bisectable released history | **squash only** (from `integration`) |
| **`integration`** | staging | the **full** `just check` green + honesty / grounding / append-only review; shared files reconciled once | `--no-ff` from `dev` (lineage preserved) |
| **`dev`** | working | **compiles + change-scoped tests pass** — messy is fine: WIP, exploration, octopus/swarm merges | octopus / `--no-ff` from feature/leaf |
| **`feature` / `leaf`** | work | the swarm's own `/dev-workflow` discipline | branched **off `dev`** |

- **Persistent + PR-gated:** `main`, `integration`, `dev` — **no direct push, PR only**. Everything
  below `dev` is ephemeral and merges freely (no PR needed).
- **Down-propagation after a release is a `--no-ff` *merge*, never a force-push** (CLAUDE.md
  mitigation #6). Because `integration → main` **squashes**, `main` diverges from the tier branches;
  the squash is brought back down by *merging* `main` into `integration` and `dev` (content becomes
  identical, `main` an ancestor of both — the tip SHAs differ by design; that is correct, not drift).
  A fast-forward is *not* possible after a squash. Force-pushes to protected branches are prohibited.
- **Doc-maintenance is part of every kickoff's DoD** — see [`_doc-maintenance.md`](_doc-maintenance.md)
  (anti-drift): each kickoff leaves `issues.yaml`, specs, `CHANGELOG`, grammar, and `docs/api-index/`
  current, so the next sequential kickoff inherits truth, not drift.

## Current kickoffs

Fire each in a **fresh session** via `/kickoff <uid>` (clean context budget). Each owns a **disjoint
tree**, branches **off `dev`**, merges into `dev`, then promotes `dev → integration → main`.

### The full-language 1.0.0 tracks (ADR-022 §5 · DN-25)

| **`rel10`** | T8 — documentation, stability & 1.0.0 release (E17-1) | `docs/**` · `CHANGELOG.md` · stability/release scope | **in progress**; M-735/736/737 landed; remaining **M-738** (release act) is `status:blocked` **purely on the maintainer's tag-cut act** (2026-07-01) — every engineering gate row it waited on (E13-1, E15-1/E25-1, ADR-023) is now closed, and E18-1 is no longer a blocker at all (ADR-036, below) |

M-739 (DN-26 plan) `done`, M-740 `in-progress`, M-970 `done`. **2026-07-06 (later, the kernel-perf wave):** the **M-994 feasibility wall is RESOLVED** — fix (a) widened L1 TCO (M-986 done), fix (b) made `Data` clone O(1) (M-987 done, ~n³→~n²), **M-995/M-996/M-999** carried both wins to the AOT env-machine which **now outruns the interpreter ~1.5–1.7×** (PRs #1189–#1194; owner-authorized §4.6 amendment + DN-56 posture row #1192).

### Phase-I function-first kickoffs (ADR-038 Accepted, 2026-07-01 · umbrella roadmap)

✅ **All five landed on `main` (2026-07-02) and are archived (2026-07-05):** `acy` (H0, commits
`6636f56`+`ba0b800`, E27-1) → `enb` (H1, PR #1020) · `opp` (PR #1020) · `grm` (H2a, PR #1051) ·
`frz` (H2 — **the kernel freeze declared**, M-969/DN-56 Enacted; PR #1051). Task ranges
M-866 + M-877…M-935 + M-958…M-969 (plus the RFC-0033-named M-766/M-767) are all `status:done` in
`issues.yaml`. Each archived file carries a completion header with its landing facts and residuals —
see §Completed (archived) below and [`archive/`](archive/). Phase I's engineering is complete; the
remaining Phase-I boundary acts are the maintainer's usability ratification + the public flip
(`flp` Stage 1) and the reserved queue (see the One-line scheduler).

### Phase-II kickoffs (post-public — ADR-038 §2.3/§2.8 · roadmap §7)

Authored 2026-07-01 by the planning tier (same discipline). `flp` is the **Phase-I→II boundary
event** — its prep may start once the Phase-I DoD is in sight, but **the flip act itself is
strictly last** and waits on the maintainer's usability ratification (ADR-036 §2.4 as refined by
ADR-038). `rwr` is deliberately **higher-altitude** (progressive, per-wave minting, decision-gated
— ADR-038 §2.3); its per-crate issues are minted per wave, not by the kickoff. All M-ids proposed,
not minted (mitigation #1).

| UID | Scope | Owns | Status / remaining |
|---|---|---|---|
| **`flp`** | **The PUBLIC FLIP (monorepo, first) + later decomposition** — **Stage 1:** flip the **monorepo** public at a `0.x` in one gated act (M-938, strictly last in Phase I). **Stage 2 (later, post-public):** author the owed decomposition ADR (ADR-039; DN-27 §4) — **pushed to the remote as the maintainer's decision point** — then per-phylum-group repos (~8–12, maintainer ⟐), per-repo CI+GHCR, issue/docs porting, spore-first re-exports, lock-then-archive the monorepo last | the monorepo flip act · the decomposition ADR · repo scaffolds + history carry · reusable CI workflows · `repo:` issue axis | 📋 planned — 11 tasks (M-936…M-946 proposed); private until the flip; **flip + ADR-039 both maintainer-gated** (usability ratification · `0.x` · FLAG-V1 · the decomposition decision on the pushed ADR) |
| **`rwr`** | **Phase-II progressive Mycelium rewrite** (post-public; the public semver climbs `0.x → 1.0.0`; `1.0.0` = fully rewritten where appropriate + 100% operational) | port-wave manifests + waves (D5/differential/D6) · transpiler hardening ladder · toolchain-port scoping · V-wave remainder (RFC-0033 M-760…M-784 incl. the single M-780 rehash at its tripwire) · the `1.0.0` terminal dossier | 📋 planned — 11 wave-level tasks (M-947…M-957 proposed); **gated on `flp` + `grm`** (mass porting) and `enb` (V-wave audit); compiler self-hosting stays an **aspiration**, not a lane (FLAG-V2) |

### Kernel-enablement

| UID | Scope | Owns | Status / remaining |
|---|---|---|---|
| **`kpr`** | E19-1 — value reprs + prims that unblock E13-1 (RFC-0032) | `crates/mycelium-interp/src/prims.rs` · `crates/mycelium-core/**` (coord `c10`) | ✅ **DONE → archived** (2026-07-01): M-746…M-752 all landed (RFC-0032 Accepted; every enabler + the M-752 Tier-2 enablement smoke ports). **E19-1 complete** — unblocks `c10`'s M-703 dependency. |

### Surface follow-ons (`crates/mycelium-l1/src/{parse,checkty,elab,mono}.rs`) — ✅ ALL COMPLETE

All surface follow-on kickoffs have landed and are **archived** (2026-06-29): **`srf`** (E7-2 — M-664
`consume` + inherent `impl`; M-668 R2 planning DN-63), **`hof`** (R3 dynamic HOF / closures, M-704),
**`lwd`** (DN-54 `derive`→L0 elaboration + sound KC-3 guard, M-812-cont), and **`strm`** (E24-1 —
M-818/M-821 mandatory `;`, M-819 `mycfmt --flatten`, M-820 `myc --stream`; **DN-57 → Enacted**). See
**§Completed (archived)** for each. **The `crates/mycelium-l1` frontend serial lane is now clear** —
the next serial-on-L1 work (`boot10` self-hosting) is **unblocked** (2026-07-01): `lib10`/E13-1 has
landed (see the resync note above). Residual status (updated
2026-06-29/30): `hof` partial-application + first-class tuple type incl. `f(x)(y)` — **RESOLVED**
(M-822/M-826); `s10` or-patterns (R20-Q3) + list inference (R20-Q5) — **RESOLVED** (M-823), only the
`for`-body→spine two-pass remains a flagged open item; `lwd` `derive`-site consumption model —
DN-54 §10 design-pass landed (M-824; DN-54 stays Accepted); `srf`/E7-2 **R2 construct activation**
(`forage`/`backbone` et al.) — now **directed** by DN-64 §7 OQ-B (M-828), future `needs-design`.

### PM tooling & post-1.0

| UID | Scope | Status / remaining |
|---|---|---|
| **`tul`** | GitHub PM tooling | M-675 (`idmap.tsv` reconcile) **done**; only **M-676** (Projects-v2 Area field) remains — deferrable/secondary (P3) |
| **`dfb`** | **the dogfooding boundary** — `crates/mycelium-web` + `crates/mycelium-adk` (NEW) | ⏸ **RE-SHELVED (2026-07-05, maintainer decision):** deferred until **after `boot10` + the public flip** (`flp` Stage 1). M-670/M-671 stay `status:blocked` (dated notes in their `issues.yaml` bodies); revisit at the flip milestone. The 2026-07-01 "unshelvable" state is resolved: the call is **re-shelve**, not resume. Research gate (`dfr`) remains discharged |

## Parallelization & sequencing guide

Collision-free-by-construction means **one kickoff owns one disjoint directory**. The only contended
file is `crates/mycelium-l1/src/{parse,checkty,elab,mono}.rs` (the L1 frontend) — everything that edits
it **must serialize**; everything else is **parallel by construction**.

### The one serial lane — `crates/mycelium-l1/src/{parse,checkty,elab,mono}.rs`

These all surgery the same L1 frontend files, so **exactly one is in flight at a time** (land + promote
green before the next — "do L1 surgery inline, never delegate to parallel leaves", CLAUDE.md #8/#10).

> ✅ **The L1 serial lane is COMPLETE (landed 2026-06-29 on `claude/sequential-kickoff-workflow-qbdigb`,
> PR #750):** `srf(M-664) → s10(M-707 → M-706) → hof(M-704) → lwd(M-812-cont) → strm(M-818) → r10(M-712)`
> all landed (run by a serial Opus swarm: one isolated-worktree leaf per task, sync-first off the

Recommended order for a *fresh* serial lane (cheapest-unblocks-most first; any order is valid as long
as it's serial). The completed lane above is kept for the method/record.

### Parallel by construction — disjoint trees (run concurrently, with each other AND the serial lane)

| Kickoff | Disjoint tree it owns | Why no collision |
|---|---|---|
| **`rel10`** | `docs/**`, `crates/mycelium-doc/**`, the release notes | docs/release; cites code read-only |
| **`tul`** (M-676) | `tools/github/**` | PM tooling only |
| **`boot10`** (M-739…M-742) | `lib/compiler/**` (new) + `mycelium-l1/**` (read/differential only) | **▶ ACTIVE** (maintainer, 2026-07-05) — Stages 0–5(inc-1) landed 2026-07-06 (PRs #1166/#1167/#1168; `/myc-dogfood` M-989 #1184). Remaining: semcore heavy core (M-993, blocked on M-994) + Stage-6/M-742 |
| **`trx2`** (M-991 + proposed) | `crates/mycelium-transpile/**` · `crates/mycelium-doc/**` · `tools/docgen/**` · a new `.myc`-draft staging dir | 📋 **STOWED — fire off `dev` after the boot10 release** (maintainer, 2026-07-06). Transpiler-accelerated porting + auto-doc-gen Mycelium doc ports; **pulls an early, boot10-supporting slice of `rwr`'s transpiler ladder forward** (Phase-II re-sequenced). Executes/extends M-991. See [`trx2.md`](trx2.md) — 4 scope decisions confirm at launch |

*(`lib10`, `kpr`, and `aot10` — formerly listed here — landed 2026-07-01 and are now archived; see
§Completed above.)*

### Sequenced by dependency (cannot start until a gate clears) — *not* parallelizable yet

- **`c10` M-703** (cut core tag) — its engineering deps (M-700/701/702, E19-1) are all `done`; gated on
  **maintainer** only (reserved).
- **`rel10` M-738** (release act) — every engineering gate row is now closed (E13-1 done via `lib10`;
  E15-1/E25-1 done via `aot10`; E18-1 non-gating per ADR-036; ADR-023/M-737 done); `status:blocked`
  **purely on the maintainer's tag-cut act** (2026-07-01); runs **last**.
- **`dfb`** (dogfooding) — **RE-SHELVED (2026-07-05, maintainer decision)** until after `boot10`
  and the public flip (`flp` Stage 1); M-670/M-671 stay `status:blocked`; revisit at the flip
  milestone.
- **Maintainer queue (reserved acts, not agent-executable):** M-703 core-tag cut · M-738 release
  act · the "fully functional + usable" ratification + public flip (`flp` Stage 1) · DN-83
  stability-window decision · M-816 stale-branch prune (~90 branches) · DN-54 derive-site
  consume-model ratification confirm · DN-73/DN-74 delegated-disposition confirms · RFC-0035
  ratification.

(`boot10` is **not** gated as a kickoff — it is the ACTIVE next kickoff (2026-07-05); inside it,
M-740 is gated only by M-739 now that its M-978 dependency cleared with the RFC-0041 promotion.)

### The integrator's shared-file rule

Kickoffs treat these **read-only** and **FLAG up**; the integrator reconciles them once at
`dev → integration`: workspace `Cargo.toml`, `CHANGELOG.md`, `docs/Doc-Index.md`,
`tools/github/issues.yaml` + `idmap.tsv`, `docs/api-index/` (regenerated, never hand-merged). Cross-work
continuity rides `issues.yaml` `depends_on` + body notes — never by touching another tree's files.

### One-line scheduler

✅ **Phase I is COMPLETE** (all five function-first kickoffs + the kernel freeze landed 2026-07-02;
the RFC-0041 wave promoted + Enacted 2026-07-05). **Next: `boot10`** — the maintainer-named next
engineering kickoff (2026-07-05): rescue the two straggler leaf branches first, M-739 → M-740
(M-978 gate cleared; TCO direct-tail-only is an M-740 acceptance criterion), with M-970 riding the
first wave as a disjoint `mycelium-fmt` leaf. **Then the maintainer queue** (reserved): M-703
core-tag cut · M-738 release act · the usability ratification + public flip (`flp` Stage 1) · DN-83
window decision · M-816 branch prune · DN-54 consume-model confirm · DN-73/DN-74 disposition
confirms · RFC-0035 ratification. `tul` keeps one deferrable P3 item (M-676); `dfb` is
**RE-SHELVED** until after `boot10`/the public flip.

## Coverage — the current set IS comprehensive for pre-dogfooding

A reverse-coverage audit (2026-06-28) confirmed every **open pre-dogfooding** task maps to a current
kickoff above. The following open items are **deliberately *not* kickoffs** (excluded from the
pre-dogfood set), so the next session doesn't chase them:

- **Done, just status-lag:** **E7-5 / M-692** (operator syntax) — satisfied by the landed M-745 (`ops`,
  RFC-0025 Enacted); flipped to `done`. **M-724** (FFI safety verify) — E14-1 is `done`; label-lag
  flipped 2026-07-01 (PR #499). **E7-1** and **E7-2** (L1 stage-1 completeness / RFC-0008 runtime
  vocabulary) — all children done; both epics flipped `done` 2026-07-01.
- **Routed into an existing kickoff:** **M-677** (declared-effects → interp budget) → `r10`.
- **Design-pending (kickoff only *after* the RFC is ratified):** **E20-1** (collections / RFC-0033,
  `proposed`), **E22-1** (security-scan / RFC-0035). **E21-1** (tunable-cert / RFC-0034) is **no
  longer design-pending** — RFC-0034 → "Enacted — with code" (2026-06-24) and all 11 children landed;
  E21-1 flipped `done` 2026-07-01.
- **Post-1.0 / release-engineering (Phase 8):** **E9-1** editor highlighting + **M-697** · **M-743**
  MIT-licensing audit · **M-744** issue-dedup.
- **Housekeeping / ongoing hardening (not feature kickoffs):** **M-674** (explicit-budget robustness) ·
  **M-797** (inline-test retrofit) · **M-816** (stale-branch pruning).

## Reserved (maintainer-only; excluded from every kickoff)
**M-655 / M-703** (cut the 1.0.0 tag) · **M-381 / M-646** (LLM local runs).
