## 1. What Phase 2 is for

Phase 1 delivered a small, auditable, executable kernel — but with three honest gaps documented
in-code, all by design: **bound composition does not exist** (the interpreter explicitly *refuses*
to compose an approximate input, `EvalError::ApproxCompositionUnsupported`); only the **bijective**
binary↔ternary swap exists (no lossy/`Bounded` swaps); and there is **no selection policy / EXPLAIN**
(packing is a default schedule, not selected). Phase 2 closes those gaps — it makes Mycelium's
*honest approximation* and *inspectable selection* real, in dependency order.

Its deliverables map to SPEC §10.7–§10.10 and Foundation §6 Phase-2:

1. The **verified-numerics foundation** (ADR-010): two bound kernels — `ErrorBound` (ε, affine
   arithmetic) and `ProbBound` (δ, union-bound / apRHL) — meeting at one shared `{ε, δ, strength}`
   certificate with a tier-i Rust checker, then wired so the interpreter composes approximate inputs
   honestly (**M-201…M-204**; E2-4 / #31). *Foundational — unblocks everything below.*
2. The **full swap surface + the single shared certificate checker** (translation validation, shared
   interp↔AOT): the split regime, the first `Bounded`/lossy swap, KC-4 overhead, SC-3 global
   (**M-210…M-212**; E2-3 / #30).
3. The **selection-policy language + mandatory EXPLAIN** (RFC-0005): one total, non-learned,
   content-addressed decision-table mechanism, two sites (swap-target + packing) (**M-220…M-222**;
   E2-6 / #33, P0).
4. **Dense embeddings + Dense↔VSA swaps** with ε/δ bounds (**M-230/M-231**; E2-1 / #28).
5. The **remaining VSA models** (MAP-B, BSC, HRR, FHRR, sparse/SBC) under the RFC-0003 §4 honest tag
   matrix (**M-240…M-242**; E2-2 / #29).
6. The **schedule-staged packing selector** + the E3 wrong-layout soundness differential
   (**M-250/M-251**; E2-7 / #34).
7. The **reconstruction manifest** (**M-260**; E2-5 / #32).

### Phase-2 exit gate (what "done" means)

Phase 2 closes when **all** of:

- **Numerics foundation** — the ε/δ kernels compose with **Soundness / Monotonicity / Determinism**
  property-tested (RFC-0001 §4.7); the tier-i checker re-validates example certificates and rejects
  a too-tight one (ADR-010); and the interpreter **composes approximate inputs honestly** (the
  `ApproxCompositionUnsupported` refusal is retired for composable inputs).
- **Full swap + shared checker** — the single translation-validation checker validates both swaps and
  the interp↔AOT differential; ≥1 `Bounded`/lossy swap ships with an honestly-derived bound; SC-3
  holds globally (every swap certified, never silent); KC-4 overhead is **measured** and recorded.
- **Selection + EXPLAIN** — every automatic selection emits a valid, deterministic EXPLAIN record;
  one mechanism serves both the swap-target and packing sites; determinism + overrides tested
  (RFC-0005).
- **Dense + VSA breadth** — Dense↔VSA swaps satisfy SC-2 with tagged ε/δ bounds; the remaining VSA
  models implement the trait with tags matching the RFC-0003 §4 matrix (HRR/FHRR unbind stays
  `Empirical`).
- **Packing + reconstruction** — the packing selector records `meta.physical` and the E3 differential
  catches a mislabeled layout (NFR-7); the reconstruction manifest recovers a novel compositional
  combination.

Maps to Foundation §6 Phase-2 success metrics: SC-2 (new swaps), SC-3 (global), the KC-4 first
measurement, NFR-7 (wrong-layout), and the SC-5 EXPLAIN channel.

Legend — **Ready**: can start now from the corpus + landed deps. **Ready after X**: a hard
dependency is open. **In progress / Done**: as the issue progresses; **Done** = landed, tests green,
issue closed.

## 3. Batch structure (the parallelization plan)

Phase 2 sequences into four batches; tasks **within** a batch touch different modules/crates and
parallelize, while batches serialize on real dependencies.

- **Batch E — verified numerics** (`mycelium-numerics`, new crate): **M-201** (ε) and **M-202** (δ)
  are independent kernels (different monoids — ADR-010/T0.1c) and parallelize; **M-203** (shared
  certificate + tier-i checker) joins them; **M-204** wires them into `mycelium-interp`. The
  selection track (**M-220/M-221**, `mycelium-select`) is independent of numerics and runs *alongside*
  Batch E.
- **Batch F — full swap** (depends on E): **M-210** (shared TV checker) → **M-230** (Dense ops, also
  needs nothing from F beyond E) → **M-211** (the first `Bounded` swap) → **M-212** (KC-4 + SC-3).
- **Batch G — breadth** (depends on E, partly F): the VSA models **M-240 → M-241 → M-242**, the
  Dense↔VSA swaps **M-231** (needs F's M-210), and the reconstruction manifest **M-260**.
- **Batch H — packing** (depends on E2-6 + lowering): **M-250** (selector) → **M-251** (E3
  differential).

---

## 4. Critical path & sequencing

```
 Batch E (mycelium-numerics + mycelium-select)
   M-201 ErrorBound (ε, affine) ─┐
   M-202 ProbBound (δ, union)  ──┤ (independent monoids — parallel)
                                 ▼
   M-203 shared {ε,δ,strength} cert + tier-i checker
                                 │
   CRITICAL PATH ▼
   M-204 interp composes approximate inputs honestly  ── retires ApproxCompositionUnsupported

   PARALLEL (independent of numerics):
   M-220 decision-table policy ─► M-221 EXPLAIN+LSP ─► M-222 wire (swap + packing sites)

 Batch F (depends on E):
   M-210 shared TV checker ─► M-230 Dense ops ─► M-211 Bounded swap (F32→BF16) ─► M-212 KC-4 + SC-3

 Batch G (depends on E, partly F):
   M-240 MAP-B/BSC ─► M-241 HRR/FHRR (Empirical) ─► M-242 sparse + §4 matrix + RR-13
   M-231 Dense↔VSA (needs M-210)      M-260 reconstruction manifest

 Batch H (depends on E2-6 + M-112):
   M-250 packing selector (I2_S/TL1/TL2) ─► M-251 E3 wrong-layout differential (NFR-7)
```

**Why M-201/M-202/M-203 are the keystone.** Every honest approximation in Phase 2 routes through the
two bound kernels and their shared certificate: the interpreter's approximate composition (M-204),
the `Bounded` swap's ε (M-211) and the checker that consumes it (M-210), the Dense↔VSA ε/δ (M-231),
the VSA `bundle`/unbind tags (M-240…M-242), and the reconstruction bound (M-260). So E2-4 is built
first; the selection track (E2-6) runs in parallel since it needs only the Core IR's `Meta`.

---

## 5. Gate verdicts — Phase-1→2 re-run of KC-1…KC-4 (honest status)

Per the honesty rule and VR-5, kill-criterion status is tracked at the strength actually
*established*. Re-run at the Phase-1→2 gate (Foundation Meta).

| Gate | Question | Phase-1→2 verdict (2026-06-09) | What moves it in Phase 2 |
|---|---|---|---|
| **KC-1** | Honest, usefully-tight bound for a core VSA op? | ✅ **confirmed (build)** — carried from Phase 1: M-001 LH probe SAFE; M-131 ships a `Proven` capacity bound via checked instantiation + ≥1e4-trial validation. No regression. | Phase 2 *extends* the pattern to MAP-B/BSC/HRR/FHRR/sparse (M-240…M-242) — each tagged at the strength its basis supports, never upgraded. |
| **KC-2** | LLM code-gen/reasoning survives the Mycelium surface? | **open — blocked (external)** — unchanged; M-002 (#3) needs LLM API access. *Structurally* unblocked by the M-110 interpreter + M-141 linter (a type-check-pass-rate harness now exists). | Out of Phase-2 scope to *run*; remains the open Phase-0 experiment. Honest verdict: not yet established. |
| **KC-3** | Kernel stays single-expert auditable? | **holding** — `mycelium-core` stayed small and by-construction-correct through Phase 1; VSA is behind the ADR-008 submodule boundary. | Phase 2 adds surface (numerics, swaps, selection, more VSA). Decision: keep numerics in a *separate* `mycelium-numerics` crate and selection in `mycelium-select` (SoC) so the core kernel does not balloon. Re-assess at the Phase-2 gate. |
| **KC-4** | Per-swap certificate-check overhead within budget? | **measured (2026-06-10, M-212)** — cert checks cost the same order as the swap itself (bijective ≈1.3× of a ~1.3 µs swap; bounded ≈0.13× of a ~16 µs swap; observational ≈10 ns) → the downgrade path is **not** triggered on this evidence. See §6.7 for the numbers + caveats. | A *ratified numeric budget* is still pending (Foundation says "an agreed budget" — a maintainer decision); re-measure on representative hardware when one is set. |

**KC-3 decision (sequencing/scope, 2026-06-09).** The two bound kernels and the selection mechanism
land as their own crates (`mycelium-numerics`, `mycelium-select`), *not* inside `mycelium-core`. This
keeps the trusted kernel auditable (KC-3 / SoC / ADR-010 "small trusted base") while the numerics
checker is a certificate *consumer*. Routed back to ADR-010 (trusted-base tiers) for the normative
basis.

## 6. Per-task detail (filled as tasks land)

### 6.1 M-201 — ErrorBound (ε) affine-arithmetic kernel · #48 · P0 · done 2026-06-09

- **Goal / acceptance (from issue).** Affine-form ε composition (`add`/`sub`/`mul`/`neg`/`scale`)
  with a radius→`eps` projection; Soundness/Monotonicity/Determinism each property-tested.
- **Delivered.** `mycelium-numerics::error`: `AffineForm` (`x₀ + Σxᵢ·εᵢ`, noise symbols `εᵢ∈[−1,1]`),
  exact linear ops (shared symbols cancel — the correlation advantage over interval arithmetic) and a
  sound `mul` (second-order remainder `≤ rad(x)·rad(y)` onto a fresh symbol). The scalar
  `ErrorBound{eps,norm}` projection carries the conservative magnitude composition used when the
  affine structure isn't available (the interpreter's case). Property tests: linear ops are *exact*
  for every noise assignment; `mul` is sound (true product ∈ `[center±radius]`); scalar `add/sub/
  scale/mul` upper-bound true deviations; monotone; deterministic; norm-mismatch refused (`None`,
  never silent). 20k trials each.
- **Honesty.** The kernel only ever *degrades* strength (composition is monotone-downward); norm
  mixing is an explicit `None`, not a coercion (G2).

### 6.2 M-202 — ProbBound (δ) union-bound kernel · #49 · P0 · done 2026-06-09

- **Goal / acceptance (from issue).** `union(δ₁..δₙ)=min(1,Σδ)`; apRHL `[SEQ]` `⟨ε,δ⟩`; Soundness/
  Monotonicity/Determinism tested; does *not* supply VSA crosstalk content (ADR-010 §5).
- **Delivered.** `mycelium-numerics::prob`: `ProbBound{delta}` with `union` (saturating at 1 — a sound
  over-approximation) and `or`; `ApRhlJudgment{eps,delta}` with `seq` (ε adds as the `e^ε` factors
  multiply, δ adds, both clamped — ADR-010 §2). Tests: union over-estimates the empirical "any fails"
  rate of independent events (200k Monte-Carlo trials); monotone + saturates; deterministic; `[SEQ]`
  composes and saturates.
- **Honesty.** A different monoid from ε by construction (T0.1c); no VSA capacity/crosstalk content
  lives here (that stays in RFC-0003's cited-theorem path).

### 6.3 M-203 — Shared `{ε,δ,strength}` certificate + tier-i checker · #50 · P0 · done 2026-06-09

- **Goal / acceptance (from issue).** `Certificate{eps,delta,strength}` (strength by `meet`,
  serializable); tier-i checker rejects a too-tight certificate; `accuracy_to_probability` the single
  legal cross-kernel rule.
- **Delivered.** `mycelium-numerics::cert`: `Certificate` (serde round-trips; range-checked
  constructor — out-of-range δ refused); `recompute_error` (the kernel re-derivation), the tier-i
  `check_error_claim`/`check_union_claim` returning `Valid` / `Rejected{recomputed,claimed}` /
  `Malformed` — a claim *tighter* than the re-derivation is **rejected**, a looser one is `Valid`
  (sound, allowed); `accuracy_to_probability` (within tolerance ⇒ inherits the accuracy confidence,
  outside ⇒ honest worst case δ=1). Also `compose_error_bound` (the M-204 entry, §6.4): composes
  approximate inputs' `Error` bounds, meeting `strength` to the weakest input and deriving a matching
  basis (Proven⊕Proven stays Proven under the affine-composition citation; Proven⊕Empirical→Empirical
  carrying the fewest trials; …⊕Declared→Declared); a non-`Error` input ⇒ `None` (refuse, never
  fabricate).
- **Honesty.** Incompleteness of the checker is an explicit `Rejected`/`Malformed`, never a silent
  pass (RFC-0002 §2); strength is never upgraded without a checked basis (VR-5).

### 6.4 M-204 — Interpreter honest approximate composition · #51 · P0 · done 2026-06-09

- **Goal / acceptance (from issue).** Retire `EvalError::ApproxCompositionUnsupported` for composable
  approximate inputs; an exact-over-exact op stays `Exact`/`bound=None`; an op over approximate inputs
  carries the kernel-composed `Bound` + meet-strength; a golden test checks the propagated
  `{bound, guarantee}` against the kernel's direct composition; M-I1…M-I4 stay enforced.
- **Delivered.** `mycelium-interp::prims`: `exact_result` generalized to `compose_result`, which
  short-circuits to `Exact`/`bound=None` when all inputs are exact (M-I1) and otherwise composes per a
  per-prim `ApproxRule`: `core.id` → `Passthrough` (the bound is preserved verbatim, citation
  included); `trit.add`/`trit.sub`/`trit.neg` → `Error(Add|Sub|Neg)` (sound 1-Lipschitz affine ε
  propagation via `mycelium_numerics::compose_error_bound`); `bit.*` and `trit.mul` → `Refuse` (no
  defined ε rule — `trit.mul` needs the central-operand magnitudes that land with the Dense numerics,
  E2-1). Strength is the `meet` of the inputs' bases (Proven⊕Proven stays Proven; …⊕Declared →
  Declared), and the basis is re-derived to match (so M-I2…M-I4 hold through `Meta::new`). Five new
  golden tests: additive composition sums ε and keeps Proven; neg preserves ε; `core.id` passes the
  bound through; the meet degrades to Declared; `trit.mul` still refuses (explicit, never silent). The
  Phase-1 `bit.not` refusal test still holds (bit ops keep `Refuse`).
- **Honesty.** Refusing was the honest Phase-1 choice; composing-with-a-checked-kernel is the honest
  Phase-2 upgrade — but only where a *sound* propagation rule exists; the rest still refuse rather
  than fabricate (G2/VR-5). This closes the documented Phase-1 honesty gap (the interpreter could not
  compose approximate inputs).

### 6.5 M-210 — Shared TV certificate checker · #52 · P0 · done 2026-06-10

- **Goal / acceptance (from issue).** One `check(A, B, R, claimed-bound, certificate)` with a
  `RefinementRelation` (bijection | bounded-similarity | observational-equiv); Exact instances
  discharge by equality, bounded instances consume the E2-4 certificate; TV incompleteness is an
  explicit fallback, never a silent pass; the M-120 cert and the M-151 differential both validate
  through the one checker.
- **Delivered.** `mycelium-cert::check` (module `check.rs`): `check(a, b, relation, claimed:
  numerics::Certificate, evidence)` → `CheckVerdict::Validated{strength}` or
  `NotValidated{reason, fallback}`. **Bijection** re-checks the lemma reference
  (`roundtrip_lemma_ref`) and the `legal_pair(n, m)` side-condition (the honesty rule — `Proven`
  only with checked side-conditions), then discharges by *structural re-derivation equality*
  (re-run `enc`/`dec` on A, compare payloads with B — the computational analogue of the SMT/
  `decide` discharge, per-instance and cheap; no per-value proof objects). **BoundedSimilarity**
  measures the actual A↔B deviation in the certificate's own norm and re-validates twice through
  the E2-4 tier-i kernel (`check_error_claim`): the certificate ε must cover the measured instance,
  and the claimed ε must not be tighter than the certificate (VR-5 — a claim never outruns its
  checked evidence); a claimed *strength* above `basis_strength(basis)` is likewise rejected.
  δ-side and non-`Error` bounds are explicit `Incomplete` (lands with M-231). **ObservationalEquiv**
  discharges by structural equality of the NFR-7 observable `(repr, payload, guarantee)`; the M-151
  differential now validates every corpus pair through this instance (and its control test asserts
  the checker rejects a genuinely divergent pair). Every non-validation carries
  `Fallback::UseReference` (refuse the swap / run the trusted interpreter, ADR-007).
- **Honesty.** TV incompleteness is a typed `Incomplete{detail}` verdict — distinct from a
  `Diverged` counterexample — and never a pass (RFC-0002 §2). Theorem citations in a `ProvenThm`
  basis are accepted axiomatically; only the arithmetic instantiation is re-checked (RFC-0002 §7).

### 6.6 M-211 — Bounded/lossy swap (Dense F32→BF16) · #53 · P1 · done 2026-06-10

- **Goal / acceptance (from issue).** `dense_f32_to_bf16` emits the converted value + a `Bounded`
  cert with a basis-derived ε bound; the cert validates through M-210; NaN/Inf handling explicit.
- **Scope note (dependency).** The issue lists M-230 (Dense ops) as a dependency; what M-211
  actually needs is the `Dense{dim, dtype}` *representation* + `Scalars` payload, which landed with
  M-101/M-103 in Phase 1 — so this was built against that, and M-230 (Dense *operations*) stays
  open and independent.
- **Delivered.** `mycelium-cert::dense`: round-to-nearest-even `F32 → BF16` (bit-level, ties to
  even), emitting `SwapCertificate::Bounded` with the proven per-element relative bound
  `{eps: 2^−8, norm: Rel}` and a `ProvenThm` basis citing the standard round-to-nearest theorem
  (Higham 2002, Thm 2.2 instantiated at β=2, p=8) — side-conditions **checked per element** (finite;
  exactly an `f32`; zero or normal; no overflow on rounding), each violation a typed explicit
  `SwapError`. The result value discloses `Proven` + the same bound (M-I2) and records
  `policy_used`. Validates through the M-210 checker under `BoundedSimilarity`; a tampered
  conversion is caught by the tier-i measured-deviation check. `CertifiedSwapEngine` now serves
  the complete certified surface (bijective binary↔ternary + bounded F32→BF16 + identity), with
  explicit `UnsupportedSwap` elsewhere. Property test: 20k-sweep relative-bound soundness +
  idempotence (output on the bf16 grid).
- **Honesty.** Subnormal inputs and approximate sources are *refused* (explicit errors), not
  tagged with a bound the theorem doesn't cover (VR-5; RFC-0002 §5 "type error, not a `Declared`
  gamble"): the subnormal absolute-spacing bound and the input-bound composition rule (E2-1) are
  honest future work, recorded here.

### 6.7 M-212 — KC-4 cert-overhead measurement + SC-3 global exit · #54 · P1 · done 2026-06-10

- **Goal / acceptance (from issue).** A bench harness reporting cert-check cost per swap kind with
  an honest measured verdict vs the KC-4 budget; a test asserting every swap in the legal-pair
  table emits and validates a certificate (SC-3 global).
- **Delivered.**
  - **KC-4 harness:** `cargo run --release -p xtask -- kc4` times every implemented swap kind and
    its M-210 check (warmup + minimum-mean-of-5-batches; refuses to measure a debug build — its
    numbers would be dishonest to record). No bench dependency (house style).
  - **Measured (2026-06-10, containerized x86-64 CI runner, single run — indicative, not a
    calibrated benchmark):**

    | Swap kind | swap | cert check | check/swap |
    |---|---|---|---|
    | bijective enc `Binary{8}→Ternary{6}` | ≈1.3 µs | ≈1.7 µs | ≈1.3× |
    | bijective dec `Ternary{6}→Binary{8}` | ≈1.3 µs | ≈1.6 µs | ≈1.3× |
    | bounded `Dense{768} F32→BF16` | ≈16 µs | ≈2.0 µs | ≈0.13× |
    | observational interp↔AOT pair | — | ≈10 ns | — |

  - **Honest KC-4 verdict (this evidence):** per-swap certificate checking costs the *same order
    as the swap itself* (the bijective check re-derives the swap, hence ~1.3×; the bounded check
    is ~13% of its swap) — microseconds, not CompCert-level effort. On this evidence the KC-4
    downgrade path (certified → declared-and-property-tested) is **not** triggered. **Caveat:**
    the Foundation specifies "an agreed budget" but none is ratified; ratifying a numeric budget
    (and re-measuring on representative hardware) is a maintainer decision — this records the
    measured number, not a pre-written "within budget".
  - **SC-3 global:** `crates/mycelium-cert/tests/sc3.rs` — every *implemented* legal-pair row
    (bijective enc/dec over four `(n, m)` pairs; bounded F32→BF16) emits a certificate that
    validates through the one checker, and every rejected/unimplemented row (out-of-range,
    illegal pair, Dense↔VSA, cross-paradigm without a rule) is an explicit error through
    `CertifiedSwapEngine` — never silent, anywhere on the surface.
- **Honesty.** The unimplemented table rows are *part of* the SC-3 statement: SC-3 demands they
  fail explicitly until their swaps exist (M-231/M-242), and the test pins exactly that.

## 7. Risks & open questions

| Id | Item | Disposition |
|---|---|---|
| **T0.1c** | ε and δ do **not** share one composition algebra (settled negative). | Accepted as inherent (ADR-010): two kernels, one certificate. The crate exposes them as separate monoids meeting at `{ε,δ,strength}`; `strength` composes by `meet`. |
| **RR-12** | Dual-path semantic divergence (interpreter vs AOT). | Carried from Phase 1; the M-210 shared checker **has folded the M-151 differential in** (every corpus pair validates through the `ObservationalEquiv` instance, done 2026-06-10), and M-251's E3 extends it to wrong-layout. |
| **RR-13** | MAP-B accuracy degrades past a nesting depth. | M-242 enforces/flags the limit explicitly — never a silent accuracy loss (G2). |
| **KC-3** | Integrative complexity → un-auditable kernel. | §5 decision: numerics + selection in separate crates; VSA stays behind ADR-008. Re-run KC-3 at the gate. |
| **KC-4** | Cert-check overhead unknown until the checker exists. | **Measured** by M-212 (2026-06-10, §6.7): same order as the swap itself — downgrade path not triggered on this evidence. Numeric budget ratification still pending (maintainer). |
| **OQ (naming)** | Issue E2-5 (#32) says `recon-info.schema.json`; the ratified file is `reconstruction-manifest.schema.json`. | The ratified name is authoritative (SPEC §10 note); M-260 reconciles the issue text. |

## 8. How this doc stays honest

- **Append-only with status transitions**, mirroring the ADR/RFC discipline: this file moves
  `Living draft → ratified` only when the Phase-2 exit gate (§1) is met; task rows update in place as
  their issues progress, but gate verdicts (§5) never pre-record an upgrade.
- **Every task row carries its issue number** (`idmap.tsv` is the join key) so the board and this doc
  cannot silently diverge.
- **Progress is reported back to the issues** — each task's substantive output links its artifact from
  the GitHub issue, and the issue is closed when its acceptance is met (or left open with an honest
  note if blocked).

## Meta — changelog & maintenance

- **2026-06-10 (E2-3 lands):** M-210/M-211/M-212 done — the shared TV checker
  (`mycelium-cert::check`, with the M-120 cert and the M-151 differential folded in as instances),
  the first `Bounded` swap (Dense F32→BF16, proven `Rel 2^−8` rounding bound), and the KC-4
  measurement + SC-3 global test. §2 rows, §5 KC-4 verdict (measured, downgrade not triggered;
  budget ratification pending), §6.5–§6.7, and the §7 RR-12/KC-4 dispositions updated. M-211
  scope note: it needed only the Phase-1 `Dense{dim,dtype}` repr; M-230 (Dense *ops*) stays open.
- **2026-06-09 (initial draft):** decomposed Phase-2 epics #28–#34 into 18 `M-2xx` tasks
  (#48–#65), created as sub-issues of their epics and appended to `idmap.tsv`. Records the readiness
  table (§2), the batch/parallelization plan (§3), the critical path with the E2-4 numerics kernels
  as keystone (§4), the honest Phase-1→2 KC-1…KC-4 re-run (§5), and a per-task detail skeleton (§6)
  to fill as tasks land. KC-3 sequencing decision: numerics + selection as separate crates.
- Maintain append-only; supersede, don't rewrite. Re-run KC-1…KC-4 at the phase gate (Foundation
  Meta). Keep `Proven|Empirical|Declared` verdicts honest per VR-5.
