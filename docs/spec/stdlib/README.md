# Spec — Standard Library module specs (`std`)

| Field | Value |
|---|---|
| **Status** | **Living index** (updated 2026-06-21) — the per-module design specs that decompose **RFC-0016** (the Core Library RFC). The **23 Rust-first module specs were `Accepted`** 2026-06-20 (DN-07, on a checked basis — guarantee matrices asserted in tests); on **2026-06-21** the maintainer additionally ratified **`runtime`** (v0 R1 surface — preconditions met, DN-16 re-audit clean; further constructs activate at the Phase-7 gate per ADR-020) and the newly-written **`sys`** spec (`mycelium-std-sys`, M-541) — completing **25/25** crate specs `Accepted`. Only **`self-hosting-readiness`** stays `Draft (needs-design)` (the M-502 gate doc, not a crate). A module spec moves to `Accepted` only when its task's acceptance is met and the maintainer ratifies — never silently. (DN-16 2026-06-21 re-audit: 25/25 ratification-ready, no honesty-tag violations.) |
| **Scope** | The home of the per-module standard-library design specs (`docs/spec/stdlib/<module>.md`). Each spec fixes a module's **scope + boundary**, its **exported-op surface**, and — the load-bearing deliverable — its **guarantee matrix** (RFC-0016 §4.5), proving the module meets the §4.1 contract **per op**, as a checked table rather than prose. |
| **Source of truth above this dir** | `docs/rfcs/RFC-0016-Core-Library-and-Standard-Library.md` (the **scope + per-op contract + taxonomy**); `docs/planning/phase-5.md` (the task decomposition M-510…M-534) |
| **Conformance template** | `docs/spec/stdlib/_TEMPLATE.md` — every module spec follows it (single-template conformance, the §4.1 doc quality-bar lint) |
| **Depends on** | RFC-0016 (the contract + taxonomy); RFC-0001 (the value model — `Value`/`Repr`/`Meta`, the guarantee lattice, content-addressing §4.6); the per-module Accepted RFC/ADR each spec grounds in |

---

## 1. What a module spec is (and is not)

A module spec is **design-first**: it fixes *what the module is, what every exported op promises, and how
that promise is checked* — not a Rust or Mycelium-lang implementation. It is the per-module deliverable the
Phase-5 tasks (`M-510…M-534`) name. Nothing here enlarges the trusted base (KC-3): the stdlib lives **above**
`mycelium-core` and the capability crates, as a certificate/EXPLAIN **consumer**.

The non-negotiable spine of every spec is the **§4.1 contract** (RFC-0016), lifted from the language's own
house rules to library scope. Every exported op must satisfy **all** of:

- **(C1) Never-silent (G2).** Every fallible op returns an explicit `Option`/`Result`/refusal that
  *propagates*; out-of-range / malformed / unsupported input is an explicit error — never a sentinel, a
  silent clamp, or a partial result.
- **(C2) Honest per-op guarantee tag (VR-5).** Any op carrying accuracy/precision/probability semantics
  tags it on `Exact ⊐ Proven ⊐ Empirical ⊐ Declared` in its `Meta`. `Proven` only with a theorem whose
  side-conditions are *checked*; otherwise `Empirical` or `Declared`. **Downgrade to stay honest; never
  upgrade without a checked basis.** An op with no accuracy semantics (e.g. `len`) is `Exact`.
- **(C3) No black boxes / EXPLAIN (SC-3/G11).** Any op that *selects*, *converts*, or *approximates*
  exposes *why* via a reified, inspectable artifact (an RFC-0005 policy + EXPLAIN record, a swap
  certificate, a diagnostic record).
- **(C4) Content-addressed, value-semantic (ADR-003 / RFC-0001).** Data structures are immutable values
  with content-addressed identity where it applies; an op is a pure function of its inputs + declared
  effects. Metadata is **not** identity.
- **(C5) Above the small kernel (KC-3).** The module consumes the kernel/capability crates but never
  enlarges the trusted base. Any `wild`/FFI (ADR-014) is confined to an audited `wild` block and is
  inventoried.
- **(C6) Declared, bounded effects (RFC-0014).** An op with effects (IO, time, randomness) **declares**
  them on its signature; unbounded effects carry an explicit budget where one applies. No undeclared side
  effect.

## 2. The guarantee matrix (every module ships one)

The load-bearing artifact. Rows = exported ops; columns =
`{ guarantee tag · fallibility (the explicit error set) · declared effects · EXPLAIN-able? }`. The
RFC-0003 §4 matrix is the proven template — encoded as data, asserted in tests, **never prose only**. The
matrix is how C1/C2/C3/C6 are *verified* rather than claimed.

## 3. Ring layering (RFC-0016 §4.2)

- **Ring 0 — kernel-adjacent re-exports** (`core`/prelude): the value model, `Option`/`Result`/error
  values, the guarantee-lattice types. Thin, mostly re-exporting `mycelium-core`. *No new trusted code.*
- **Ring 1 — capability surfaces** (Tier A): ergonomic libraries over the landed capability crates
  (`numerics`, `swap`, `vsa`, `dense`, `select`, `diag`, `recover`, `ternary`, `content`). Certificate /
  EXPLAIN **consumers**.
- **Ring 2 — general library** (Tier B): collections, text, math, iter, error, io, etc., written to the
  contract over Ring 0/1.

## 4. Module spec index

### Keystone & gate

| Doc | Task | Role | Status |
|---|---|---|---|
| [`../../rfcs/RFC-0016-Core-Library-and-Standard-Library.md`](../../rfcs/RFC-0016-Core-Library-and-Standard-Library.md) | M-501 | the contract + taxonomy keystone (every spec traces to its §4.1) | **Accepted** (2026-06-17, maintainer; DN-07) — phylum `std`; full 23-module v0 taxonomy; §8 resolved/deferred (see §5 Net) |
| [`self-hosting-readiness.md`](./self-hosting-readiness.md) | M-502 | the *checkable* self-hosting verdict — gates the Mycelium-lang migration half (RFC-0016 §4.6), not the Rust-first specs/impls | **Draft (needs-design)** — verdict: *not yet established* |

**Wave status:** `Draft — landed` was the design-wave state — the spec authored + integrated, awaiting
ratification. The **first wave** landed the Tier-A differentiators `core`/`swap`/`ternary`/`dense`/
`select`/`content` + the Tier-B commons `iter`/`math`/`error`/`cmp`/`fmt`; the **second wave** landed the
remainder (`numerics`/`vsa`/`diag`/`recover`/`runtime`/`spore` + `collections`/`text`/`io`/`fs`/`time`/
`rand`/`testing`) — every module in the RFC-0016 taxonomy got a `Draft` spec. **Ratified 2026-06-20
(DN-07):** the **23 Rust-first specs moved `Draft — landed` → `Accepted`** on a checked basis (each spec's
own Status line + the changelog below carry the per-spec disposition); **`runtime` and
`self-hosting-readiness` stay `Draft (needs-design)`** (Phase-7 / migration-gated). The index tables below
keep their `Draft — landed` cells as **append-only design-wave history** — each spec's Status line is the
authoritative current state. Cross-module FLAGs reconciled in §5.

### Tier A — differentiator modules (RFC-0016 §4.3)

### Tier B — common / expected modules (RFC-0016 §4.4)

| Module | Spec | Task | Honesty crux | Wave status |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `iter` | [`iter.md`](./iter.md) | M-526 (#167) | total/terminating where the kernel guarantees it | **Draft — landed** |

| `rand` | [`rand.md`](./rand.md) | M-531 (#171) | nondeterminism reified/named (RT3) | **Draft — landed** |
| `testing` | [`testing.md`](./testing.md) | M-534 (#174) | a skipped check is reported, never a silent pass | **Draft — landed** |

## 5. Cross-module reconciliation (first design wave)

The wave authored each spec independently, so the seams **between** modules are reconciled here (the
orchestrator's deconfliction job). Each spec FLAGs its own open questions in its §7; below are only the
points that span modules. Most map onto an existing **RFC-0016 §8** question — recorded for the maintainer
to resolve at ratification, **not** silently decided here (the planning analogue of G2).

| Seam | Modules | Reconciliation | Maps to |
|---|---|---|---|
| **The swap ↔ convert boundary** | `swap` (M-516), `cmp`/`convert` (M-532) | **Mostly consistent — one residual placement FLAGGED.** The clear cases agree: a certified *representation* change (binary↔ternary, M-120; the lossy `F32→BF16`, M-211; `Dense↔VSA`, M-231) lives in **`swap`** (certificate-carrying), and ordinary same-paradigm widening/narrowing (`i8→i32`; fallible `i32→i8`) lives in **`cmp`/`convert`**. The **one open sub-seam** is the *lossless reverse* `BF16→F32` widening: `swap.md` §7 FLAGs its placement and proposes it lift to `cmp`/`convert` (lossless float widening, no certificate needed) rather than `swap` — not yet ratified. No op is double-owned today; the `BF16→F32` owner is the FLAG to close. | **FLAGGED** (swap §7-Q3 / cmp §7-Q2) |
| **Numeric ε bounds ownership** | `dense` (M-518), `math` (M-525) | **Consistent deferral.** Both route float-op ε through the verified numerics (`std.numerics`, M-512 / ADR-010) and **cite, never restate** the bound; both tag `Proven` *only* where Higham's side-conditions are checked, else honestly downgrade. The concrete ε constants are M-512's to fill — neither spec fabricated them. **→ SUPERSEDED (second wave): M-512 landed; the carrier is homed — see "The numerics carrier (`Approx<T>`) + the ε numbers" below.** | §8-Q1 (module set) |
| **JSON projection overlap** | `fmt` (M-533), `serialize` (M-514) | **Deferred to when `serialize` lands.** `fmt.to_json` and `serialize`'s JSON both claim "dual human/machine projection". Proposed: one canonical JSON projection that `fmt` delegates to; reconcile when M-514 is authored. **→ SUPERSEDED (second wave): M-514 landed; see "One canonical JSON projection" below.** | §8-Q1/§8-Q3 |
| **The recovery bridge** | `error` (M-527), `recover` (M-520) | **Co-design flag.** `error`'s `recover`-bridge signature (`RecoverOutcome`/`PolicyRef`) is owned by `std.recover` (RFC-0014); `error` described it abstractly without fabricating it. Reconcile the exact signature when M-520 lands. **→ SUPERSEDED (second wave): M-520 landed; see "The recovery bridge (now owned)" below.** | §8-Q1 |
| **content-hash vs hash-for-maps** | `content` (M-523), `collections` (M-511, *anticipated*) | **Boundary stated.** `content` owns *identity* hashing (canonical content-addressing, ADR-003); `collections` owns *non-identity* hashing-for-maps. Kept distinct. | — |
| **Early-termination over a total `for` fold** | `iter` (M-526) → RFC-0007 §4.8 | **Question back to the kernel.** Short-circuit combinators (`any`/`all`/`find`) over the no-`break` total fold either use a done-flag fold (total, walks the full spine) or motivate an early-termination kernel primitive. FLAGGED to RFC-0007, not decided here. | RFC-0007 §4.8 |
| **Naming** (`Bit`/`Trit`, the `std` phylum, re-export names, the canonical error-value identifier) | `core`, `ternary`, `swap`, `content` | All defer to the DN-02/06 lexicon decision; `core` and `error` must agree the **one** error-value name; no spec committed a name the corpus hasn't ratified. | **§8-Q2** |
| **Ergonomics vs the contract** (always-explicit EXPLAIN/certificate/tag/identity-ref at the call site vs implicit-but-inspectable) | `swap`, `select`, `content`, `math`, `error`, `iter`, `fmt` | The single most recurrent tension (tension A). Every affected spec FLAGs it rather than choosing; needs one per-ring design pass, not seven per-module answers. | **§8-Q3** |
| **The migration differential's bar** | `swap`, `self-hosting-readiness` (M-502) | What a self-hosted module must match (observable results vs tags+EXPLAIN bit-for-bit) before its verdict flips. | **§8-Q5** |
| **`wild`/FFI for transcendentals** | `math` (M-525) | Whether `math`'s transcendental floor is a pure trusted routine or libm via `wild` (which would narrow its C5 "no `wild`" claim). | **§8-Q6** |
| **The numerics carrier (`Approx<T>`) + the ε numbers** | `numerics` (M-512), `math` (M-525), `dense` (M-518) | **Resolved on the `numerics` side.** `numerics` homes the carrier `math`/`dense` deferred: `Approx<T>` is a *thin view* — a plain value with its `Meta`-attached `{Bound, strength}` (RFC-0001 §4.3), **not** a new numeric type and **not** a kernel change — closing `math` §7-Q1 and `dense` §7-Q5. The concrete ε magnitudes and *which* transcendentals reach `Proven` stay ADR-010/the kernels' to supply; `numerics` fixes the never-upgrade discipline, meet-composition, and the refuse-without-a-rule (M-204) posture, not the numbers. | §8-Q1 (supersedes the "Numeric ε bounds ownership" FLAG) |
| **The recovery bridge (now owned)** | `recover` (M-520), `error` (M-527), `diag` (M-510) | **Owner landed.** `recover` defines the concrete `Outcome`/`RecoverOutcome`/`PolicyRef` surface `error` described abstractly (consistent with `error`'s bridge); `diag` owns the structured record/trace a recovered-or-re-propagated error carries (presentation never gates propagation, I1); `recover` decides policy, `diag` records. Recovery elaborates to L0 `Match` — no new kernel node (KC-3/NFR-7). | resolves the prior "recovery bridge" FLAG |
| **The failure-legibility substrate** | `diag` (M-510), `recover` (M-520), `testing` (M-534), every fallible module | **One substrate, consistently consumed.** The maintainer's failure-semantics rule — a program *may* fail, but every failure is a structured RFC-0013 record with a trace + debug info, recovered or re-propagated, **never silently swallowed** (I1) — is discharged once in `diag` and consumed by `recover` (policy), `testing` (a `Fail` is a `diag` record), and every module's `Err` rows. No module re-invents the record. | — |
| **One canonical JSON projection** | `io`/`serialize` (M-514), `fmt` (M-533) | **Resolved — delegation wired (M-372, 2026-06-19).** `io`/`serialize` owns the single canonical JSON projection; `fmt.to_json`/`from_json` **delegate** to `mycelium_std_io::{to_json, from_json}` (one JSON, two entry points; round-trip established once in `std.io`, re-checked in `std.fmt`). **Tag-framing residual (honesty, VR-5 — for the maintainer):** `std.io` tags `from_json` `Empirical` (proptest corpus); `std.fmt` tags it `Exact` (deterministic decode, no accuracy semantics). Both are honest from their angle; framing reconciliation is deferred to the maintainer and recorded as a noted residual in both specs (fmt §7-Q1 / io §7-Q1). | §8-Q1/§8-Q3 |
| **The `wild`/FFI floor (consolidated)** | `fs` (M-528), `rand` (M-531), `math` (M-525) | **One `std-sys` question, three call sites.** OS/platform facilities — `fs` syscalls, `rand`'s platform entropy, `math`'s transcendental libm floor — each bottom out in an audited `wild` block (ADR-014) and may live in a separate `std-sys` phylum so pure `std` stays leak-free (LR-9). The same §8-Q6 decision, now corroborated from three modules. | **§8-Q6** |
| **Declared nondeterminism (RT3)** | `time` (M-529), `rand` (M-531) | **One rule, two sources.** A wall-clock read and an entropy draw are both nondeterminism under RT3 and both carry a declared effect; a deterministic fragment can do neither silently. Named once, shared — `time` owns clock reads, `rand` owns generators; the seeded/logical (pure) surfaces stay reproducible. | — |
| **The `runtime` phylum + Phase-7 gate** | `runtime` (M-521) | **Reserved, not active.** The RFC-0008 concurrency lexicon (hypha/colony/reclaim/…) is mostly reserved vocabulary (Glossary ⟂); the spec presents the binding set + the std-vs-separate-`runtime`-phylum decision as a FLAG and activates construct-by-construct as Phase-7 lands — no premature surface (VR-5). | **§8-Q4** |
| **The deployable spore** | `spore` (M-522), `vsa` (M-513), `content` (M-523), native path (M-620) | **Boundary stated.** `spore` packages a content-addressed deployable + reconstruction manifest; `content` owns the canonical hash identity; `vsa` performs the probabilistic regrowth (held at the FR-C2 `Empirical` ceiling); the full *native* deploy is Phase-6-gated on M-620. | §8-Q1 |
| **The differential / oracle bar** | `testing` (M-534), `swap` (M-516), `self-hosting-readiness` (M-502) | **Same bar, reused.** `testing`'s `differential` harness adopts whatever interp↔AOT/native agreement bar (observable results vs results+tags+EXPLAIN) the migration differential ratifies — the same §8-Q5 question, not a new one. | **§8-Q5** |

**Net (after the second wave):** with all 23 module specs drafted, **no two specs conflict on an *owned*
surface.** The first wave's unsettled `BF16→F32` placement (swap §7-Q3 / cmp §7-Q2) is unchanged and still
FLAGGED. The second wave *resolved* two prior deferrals — the numerics carrier (`Approx<T>` = a `Meta`-attached
bound, closing `math`/`dense`) and the recovery bridge (`recover` now owns the concrete `Outcome`/`PolicyRef`)
— and *converged* the JSON projection (`fmt` delegates to `serialize`) from both sides. The remaining recurring
items are the *known* RFC-0016 §8 questions — naming §8-Q2, ergonomics-vs-contract §8-Q3 (tension A),
the `wild`/`std-sys` floor §8-Q6 (now corroborated by `fs`/`rand`/`math`), the `runtime` Phase-7 phylum §8-Q4,
and the differential bar §8-Q5 — each now corroborated from many independent angles. That convergence is the
useful signal for the maintainer's ratification pass; nothing here silently decides a §8 question.

**Ratification dispositions (2026-06-17, maintainer; RFC-0016 now Accepted; DN-07).** The §8 questions and
the residual FLAG above are now ruled on (recorded append-only in RFC-0016 §8 + its changelog). The table
rows above are kept verbatim as the design-wave history; the rulings supersede their "FLAGGED" state:

- **`BF16→F32` placement → RESOLVED:** the lossless reverse widening lifts to **`cmp`/`convert`** (no
  certificate); `swap` keeps only the certified/lossy direction. The last open *owned-surface* seam is closed.
- **§8-Q2 naming → RESOLVED:** phylum **`std`**; module names **mirror the capability-crate names**; themed
  names only where the corpus already has one (`spore`, `runtime`); `core`/`error` share the **one**
  error-value identifier (DN-03).
- **§8-Q5 differential bar → RESOLVED:** a **two-level bar** — M-210 observable-result equivalence (floor) +
  per-module tag/EXPLAIN equivalence (honesty-load-bearing modules).
- **§8-Q6 `wild`/`std-sys` floor → RESOLVED:** the audited `wild` floor (`fs`/`rand`/`math`) splits into a
  separate **`std-sys` phylum** (LR-9 leak-free `std`); the minimal audited FFI inventory is a follow-on
  (**M-541**).
- **§8-Q3 ergonomics-vs-contract → DEFERRED-WITH-DIRECTION:** adopt the **RFC-0012 ambient direction**
  library-wide (implicit-but-inspectable, EXPLAIN-able); discharge via one **per-ring design pass** (**M-540**).
- **§8-Q4 `runtime` phylum → DEFERRED (Phase-7):** a separate `runtime` phylum, activated construct-by-construct
  at the Phase-7 gate.
- **RFC-0016 §7 grounding → DISCHARGED:** `research/08-honest-stdlib-prior-art-RECORD.md` (T8.1–T8.7) traces
  the cross-language module-set comparison + the "honest stdlib" prior art.

The Mycelium-lang *migration half* of M-510…M-520 still waits on the concrete L3 authoring surface
(KC-2-gated; RFC-0006 §10; self-hosting capability #3 — `self-hosting-readiness.md`); the Rust-first specs +
implementations proceed against RFC-0016 now.

## 6. How this index stays honest

- **Append-only with status transitions**, mirroring the ADR/RFC discipline: a module row moves
  `design landing → Draft (needs-design) → Accepted` only as the spec actually lands and is ratified;
  it never pre-records a module as done.
- **Every spec traces to RFC-0016 + its Accepted corpus**; a module whose Mycelium-specific intent is
  unclear is a FLAGGED open question (RFC-0016 §8), never a silently-invented design choice (the planning
  analogue of never-silent, G2).

## Meta — changelog

- **2026-06-20 — 23 Rust-first specs ratified `Draft — landed` → `Accepted` (DN-07; PR #228).** The
  maintainer ran the DN-07 per-spec ratification pass: the 23 Rust-first module specs (`cmp`, `collections`,
  `content`, `core`, `dense`, `diag`, `error`, `fmt`, `fs`, `io`, `iter`, `math`, `numerics`, `rand`,
  `recover` [Rust-first half], `select`, `spore` [library/manifest half], `swap`, `ternary`, `testing`,
  `text`, `time`, `vsa`) move to **`Accepted`** on a **checked basis** — each carries its RFC-0016 §4.5
  guarantee matrix asserted in tests; **no guarantee tag was upgraded without a checked basis** (VR-5; open
  §7/§8 items stay design/scope calls, not contract violations). **`runtime` and `self-hosting-readiness`
  remain `Draft (needs-design)`** (Phase-7 / migration-gated). The per-spec Status lines carry the
  authoritative disposition; the index tables' `Draft — landed` cells are kept verbatim as append-only
  design-wave history. The Mycelium-lang *migration half* (M-502-gated) still remains. Append-only.
- **2026-06-19 — §5 "One canonical JSON" seam resolved/wired (M-372).** The §5 reconciliation row for the `fmt`↔`io` JSON-projection seam moves from "pending maintainer sign-off" to **resolved — delegation wired (M-372, 2026-06-19)**: `fmt.to_json`/`from_json` now delegate to `mycelium_std_io::{to_json, from_json}`; the round-trip property is established once in `std.io`, re-checked in `std.fmt`. Tag-framing residual noted (io `Empirical` vs fmt `Exact` for `from_json`; see fmt §7-Q1 / io §7-Q1) — preserved as a noted residual for the maintainer (VR-5), not silently resolved. The §5 history row is kept verbatim (append-only); this entry supersedes only the "pending sign-off" portion. No spec status change; no public API change; no other seams affected. Append-only.
- **2026-06-17 — RFC-0016 ratified (keystone → Accepted); §8 dispositions recorded.** The maintainer ran the
  DN-07 ratification pass: the keystone row moves **Draft → Accepted** (phylum `std`; full 23-module v0
  taxonomy). §5 gains a **Ratification dispositions** block: `BF16→F32` → `cmp`/`convert` (RESOLVED, last
  owned-surface seam closed), Q2 naming (`std` + crate-mirrored + one error-value name, RESOLVED), Q5
  two-level differential bar (RESOLVED), Q6 `std-sys` split (RESOLVED; FFI inventory → M-541), Q3
  ergonomics-vs-contract (DEFERRED-WITH-DIRECTION — RFC-0012 ambient; per-ring pass → M-540), Q4 `runtime`
  (DEFERRED to Phase-7); the §7 grounding obligation DISCHARGED (`research/08-honest-stdlib-prior-art-RECORD.md`).
  The §5 history rows are kept verbatim (append-only); the rulings supersede their FLAGGED state. The
  per-module specs stay `Draft` (only the keystone is ratified); the Mycelium-lang migration half still waits
  on the KC-2-gated concrete L3 surface (M-502). Append-only.
- **2026-06-17 — Second design wave integrated.** Lands the remaining 13 module specs, completing the
  RFC-0016 taxonomy as `Draft`: Tier-A `numerics` (M-512, #153), `vsa` (M-513, #154), `diag` (M-510, #151),
  `recover` (M-520, #156), `runtime` (M-521, #162), `spore` (M-522, #163); Tier-B `collections` (M-511, #152),
  `text` (M-524, #165), `io`/`serialize` (M-514, #155), `fs` (M-528, #169), `time` (M-529, #170),
  `rand` (M-531, #171), `testing` (M-534, #174). Flips their index rows `anticipated → Draft — landed`, and
  extends §5 with the second-wave seams — the numerics carrier (`Approx<T>` resolved on the `numerics` side,
  closing `math`/`dense`), the recovery bridge (now owned by `recover`), the one-canonical-JSON convergence
  (`fmt` delegates to `serialize`), the consolidated `wild`/`std-sys` floor (`fs`/`rand`/`math`, §8-Q6), the
  shared RT3 declared-nondeterminism rule (`time`/`rand`), the reserved `runtime` Phase-7 phylum (§8-Q4), the
  deployable-spore boundary (`spore`/`vsa`/`content`/M-620), and the reused differential bar (§8-Q5). A common
  failure-legibility rule is recorded: a program *may* fail, but every failure is a structured RFC-0013 record
  with a trace + debug info, recovered or re-propagated, never silently swallowed (I1) — discharged in `diag`,
  consumed everywhere. No two specs conflict on an owned surface; the open items are the known §8 questions,
  not silent decisions. No code; no kernel change (KC-3). Append-only.
- **2026-06-17 — Created (Living index).** Stands up the per-module standard-library spec directory under
  **RFC-0016 (Draft)**: the §4.1 contract reference (C1–C6), the guarantee-matrix obligation (§4.5), the
  ring layering (§4.2), the single-template conformance rule, and the module index keyed to the Phase-5
  tasks (M-510…M-534). Marks the first orchestration wave's `design landing` set (Tier-A differentiators
  `core`/`swap`/`ternary`/`dense`/`select`/`content` + Tier-B pure commons `iter`/`math`/`error`/`cmp`/
  `fmt`); the remainder are `anticipated` for later waves. No code; no kernel change (KC-3). Append-only.
