## 1. Summary

Errors in Mycelium are **load-bearing values**, never telemetry: a swap out of range, a failed
certificate, an unresolved name, a `CheckVerdict::NotValidated` carrying a *reason* and a *fallback* are
all explicit `Option`/error/refusal values that **propagate** (G2 never-silent). RFC-0013 added a way to
**present** that structured error (graded, dual-format, reified policy). It deliberately stopped at
presentation and **deferred recovery** (DN04-Q1) — because recovery edges into control flow and could,
done carelessly, become the substitutive black box the project forbids.

This RFC designs that deferred half: a way for a developer to **declaratively recover from — and act on —
errors**, so an error can *trigger functionality* (fallback, retry, cleanup, branch selection, escalation,
and novel uses), built as an **isolated, separable subsystem** with a **bounded blast radius**. Its
governing discipline, per the maintainer (2026-06-16):

> Errors propagate / bubble and can **trigger functionality**. Effects — including cascades — are
> **allowed when they are explicitly declared and implemented**, so they stay **known and bounded**. The
> enemy is *unintended / unknown / unbounded* effects (a memory explosion, a runaway cascade, spooky
> action at a distance), **not** effects per se. The default is **tightly scoped, bounded** effects; a
> developer **opts into broader effect/cascade behaviour by explicitly declaring and implementing it** —
> it never arrives implicitly. Recovery is always **additive over** the explicit error: it may act on the
> error and produce a *new explicit outcome*, but it may never make the original refusal vanish unobserved
> (G2).

The design rests on three pillars — **errors-as-propagating-values** (the substrate, RFC-0001), **explicit
declarative recovery** (the control: an explicit handling site + a reified RFC-0005-pattern recovery
policy), and **declared, bounded effects** (the safety: every potentially-unbounded effect carries an
explicit budget and overruns gracefully, generalising the fuel clock). It is **separable from RFC-0013**
(presentation vs. recovery) and keeps the trusted kernel small (KC-3): recovery elaborates to existing L0
where possible (a `Match` on an error sum), and the only runtime addition is **effect-budget enforcement**,
which lives where fuel and depth budgets already live (RFC-0004/0008, DN-05) — not in the kernel calculus.

## 2. Motivation

- **It completes the error story honestly.** RFC-0001/0013 made errors explicit and presentable; without
  recovery, the only responses are "propagate to the top" or "match by hand everywhere." Mycelium needs a
  *declarative, reified* way to act on errors that stays inside the never-silent contract (G2).
- **It is the maintainer's signature requirement, recorded.** Errors must be usable for everything errors
  are used for today (fallback, retry, cleanup, control branching) **and** novel uses — but the language
  must stay *maintainable, stable, and easy to use*, with **no unintended/unknown/unbounded side effects**.
  That tension — expressive error-driven control vs. no spooky cascades — is exactly what this RFC resolves
  by making effects explicit, declared, and budgeted.
- **It separates two concerns cleanly (SoC).** A *diagnostic policy* (RFC-0013) changes how an error is
  *shown*; a *recovery policy* (this RFC) changes what *happens* on an error. Keeping them in two RFCs /
  two subsystems means neither can destabilise the other, and a recovery feature can never silently weaken
  RFC-0013's "additive presentation" invariant.
- **It reuses Mycelium's own safety idiom.** The kernel already refuses to hang: every `Fix`/`FixGroup`
  unfold is clocked (RFC-0007 §4.5) and the control stack has a depth ceiling (M-347, DN-05), each overrun
  an *explicit, graceful* error. Bounded effects are the same idea applied to recovery: a retry has a max
  count, a cascade a depth bound, an allocation a ceiling — overrun is `EffectBudgetExhausted`, never OOM.

## 3. Guide-level explanation

> **Syntax below is illustrative, not normative.** Concrete surface syntax is KC-2-gated (RFC-0006 §10);
> this RFC fixes the *semantics and the discipline*, not the spelling.

### 3.1 Errors are values that bubble up

A fallible operation yields an explicit result value — a sum of success or a structured error (the
RFC-0001 `Option`/error/refusal; `Err` carries a reason and, where available, a fallback). By default an
error **propagates** (bubbles) to the caller; nothing is silently swallowed (G2). An explicit propagation
form (a `?`-style operator or an explicit match) makes "pass this error up" visible at the use site —
never an invisible unwinding:

```text
let v = parse(bytes)?        -- on Err, the error bubbles to this function's caller (explicit `?`)
```

### 3.2 Recovery happens at an explicit site

To *act on* an error instead of propagating it, a developer writes an **explicit handling site** that
matches the error and produces a new explicit outcome — a recovered value, or a transformed/re-raised
error. This is just pattern-matching on the error sum at a visible site (it elaborates to an L0 `Match`):

```text
handle parse(bytes) {
  Ok(v)                 => v,
  Err(Truncated)        => default_record,          -- recover with a fallback value
  Err(e)                => reraise(annotate(e)),     -- transform and re-propagate (still explicit)
}
```

A handling site must cover the error's cases or re-propagate the rest — it can **never** drop an unmatched
error (never-silent). A fallback value carries an **honest guarantee tag** (e.g. `Declared`), never a
fabricated one (VR-5).

### 3.3 Reusable recovery is a reified policy

For recovery that recurs across definitions, a **reified recovery policy** (the RFC-0005 pattern, like
RFC-0013's diagnostic policy) attaches a *named, content-addressed, `EXPLAIN`-able* recovery action to a
definition or scope:

```text
on Truncated  => fallback(default_record)            -- a declared recovery action
on Timeout    => retry(max_attempts: 3)              -- a BOUNDED retry (see §4.5)
on Fatal      => cleanup_then_propagate(release)     -- act, then let the error continue (additive)
```

The action is explicit. If a policy does not fully recover (e.g. retries exhausted), the error **continues
to propagate** — a policy is additive over the error, never a silent terminator.

### 3.4 Effects are declared and bounded

Recovery actions can *do things* (retry, allocate, clean up, cascade). Those are **effects**, and Mycelium
requires them to be **declared** and **bounded**:

- **Declared:** a definition that performs an effect names it in its signature, so a caller can see what it
  can do — there are **no undeclared effects** (no unknown side effects).
- **Bounded:** any effect that could be unbounded carries an explicit **budget** (a retry's `max_attempts`,
  a cascade's `max_depth`, an allocation's ceiling). Exceeding the budget is an **explicit, graceful error**
  (`EffectBudgetExhausted`), never a hang or an out-of-memory abort.
- **Tightly scoped by default; broader is opt-in.** The default effect scope is the narrowest. A developer
  who *wants* a broader effect or a cascade **declares and implements it explicitly** — it never arrives by
  default.

```text
fn save(r: Record) -> Result<Unit> !{ retry(<=3), alloc(<=64KiB) } = ...   -- declared, bounded effects
```

Reading rules a developer internalises: *a recovery never silently swallows an error; an effect a function
can perform is visible in its signature; every effect that could run away is budgeted, and a budget overrun
is an explicit error; broader/cascading effects are something you opt into by declaring them, never a
surprise.*

## 4. Reference-level design (normative once Accepted)

### 4.1 The substrate: errors are explicit, propagating values (G2; RFC-0001)

This RFC adds **no new error representation**: it builds on RFC-0001's explicit `Option`/error/refusal
values and `CheckVerdict::NotValidated` (reason + fallback). A fallible computation yields a **result sum**
`Ok(τ) | Err(ε)` where `ε` is a structured error value (carrying a class, a reason, optionally a fallback —
the same structured error RFC-0013 *presents*). Errors **propagate by default**; an explicit propagation
form surfaces "bubble this up" at the use site. There is no implicit, invisible unwinding.

### 4.2 The governing invariant — recovery is additive, never silent (G2)

**(I1) A handler acts on an error and produces a new explicit outcome; it never makes the error vanish
unobserved.** For every error `e`, a recovery construct either (a) **recovers** — yields an explicit
success value, where the original `e` is *consumed by an explicit, total-over-its-cases match* — or (b)
**re-propagates** — yields an explicit error (possibly `e` transformed/annotated). There is **no handler,
policy, or effect that can cause `e` to neither surface nor be explicitly recovered.** A handling site that
does not cover all cases re-propagates the remainder; it cannot drop it. This is the operational form of
never-silent (G2) for recovery, and the normative core the §5 verification defends.

**(I2) Recovery never fabricates or upgrades a guarantee (VR-5).** A recovered/fallback value carries an
honest guarantee on the lattice `Exact ⊐ Proven ⊐ Empirical ⊐ Declared`; a substituted fallback is at most
`Declared` (flagged) unless it has an independent checked basis. Recovery may only **downgrade** to stay
honest, never upgrade.

### 4.3 Explicit handling sites (KC-3: no new kernel node)

The explicit handling site (§3.2) is **surface sugar that elaborates to existing L0**: a `handle e { … }`
is a `Match` on the result-sum value (RFC-0001 r3 `Match` + the data registry), with the `Err` arms
producing recovered values or re-raised errors. **No new L0 node is required** for explicit handling — it
is `Construct`/`Match` over the error sum, exactly the fragment the three-way differential already covers
(NFR-7). This keeps the trusted kernel untouched (KC-3) and recovery *inspectable* (it is ordinary matching,
`EXPLAIN`-able like any term).

### 4.4 Reified recovery policies (RFC-0005 pattern; ADR-006)

A recovery policy is a **reified, inspectable, content-addressed artifact**, in the posture ADR-006/RFC-0005
mandate (and RFC-0013 reuses for diagnostics):

```text
on <ErrorClass> => <RecoveryAction>
```

- **`<ErrorClass>`** resolves through the **shared error-class registry** (RFC-0013 §4.5) — a name in a
  known set, **never an evaluated string** (the RFC-0013 X1 exclusion applies equally here). An unknown
  class is an explicit configuration error.
- **`<RecoveryAction>`** is one of a closed, declared set (v0): `fallback(value)` (recover with an honest
  fallback, §4.2 I2); `retry(<=N)` (re-attempt, **bounded**, §4.5); `escalate(class')` (re-propagate as a
  transformed error); `cleanup_then_propagate(effect)` (run a bounded effect, then let the error continue —
  additive). Each action is explicit; none may silently terminate an error (I1).

A policy is **content-addressed and `EXPLAIN`-able**: every recovered or re-propagated outcome records the
`PolicyRef` of the policy that shaped it (RFC-0005 §3), so one can always answer *"which policy acted on
this error, and what does it do?"*. A recovery policy is a **strict superset of permission** over an
RFC-0013 diagnostic policy on the same error — but the two are **separate artifacts** (§4.9): a diagnostic
policy can never change control flow, and a recovery policy's presentation is delegated to RFC-0013.

### 4.5 Declared, bounded effects (the safety discipline)

This is the heart of the RFC and the maintainer's central constraint.

**(I3) Effects are declared.** A definition that performs an effect declares it in an **effect annotation**
on its signature — a set drawn from a closed kernel of effect *kinds* (e.g. `retry`, `alloc`, `io`,
`cascade`) plus user-declared effect names. A caller of a definition sees its declared effects; **a
definition may not perform an undeclared effect** (checked above the kernel). This is the "no unknown side
effects" guarantee: effects are visible, not ambient. (v0 is **coarse** — a declared effect *set*, not full
effect-row polymorphism; richer effect typing is deferred, §8/§9 — KISS/YAGNI.)

**(I4) Effects that can be unbounded are budgeted, and an overrun is explicit and graceful.** Every effect
whose cost is not statically bounded carries an explicit **budget** — a `retry` carries `max_attempts`, a
`cascade` carries `max_depth`, an `alloc` carries a memory ceiling, a `time`-bearing effect a fuel-style
clock. Exceeding a budget yields an **explicit `EffectBudgetExhausted`** value (a structured error, subject
to §4.2 I1) — **never** a hang, a stack overflow, or an out-of-memory abort. This is the direct
generalisation of the established budget discipline: the `Fix`/`FixGroup` fuel clock (RFC-0007 §4.5), the
control-stack depth ceiling (M-347), and the dynamically-resolved budgets of DN-05 §2.4. Budgets are
themselves **`EXPLAIN`-able** and may be resolved by policy (a static default or a memory-derived ceiling,
DN-05), never hidden.

**(I5) The default is tightly scoped; broader effects are opt-in by explicit declaration + implementation.**
The narrowest effect scope is the default. A broader or cascading effect is permitted **only** when a
developer **explicitly declares and implements it** (its declaration *and* its bound). A cascade is allowed
*iff* it is declared with a `max_depth` (or equivalent) bound — so cascades are *known and bounded*, never
unbounded. There is no path by which an effect or cascade arrives implicitly.

### 4.6 Effects are reified & inspectable (no black box)

An effect declaration, its budget, and its handling policy are **reified, content-addressed artifacts** —
`EXPLAIN` can always answer *"what effects can this code perform, with what bounds, handled by what
policy?"*. This is the SC-3 / no-black-box stance applied to effects: control flow that *does something* is
never opaque or ambient; it is a declaration you can read, diff, and trace.

### 4.7 Totality & honesty interaction (matured ⟹ total under budgets)

- **Totality (RFC-0004 §4 / RFC-0007 §4.5).** Because every effect that could diverge is budgeted (I4), a
  recovering, bounded-effect definition **terminates**: it recovers, re-propagates, or hits a budget and
  yields `EffectBudgetExhausted`. The structural totality checker (outside the kernel) accounts for declared
  effects and their budgets when classifying `total`/`partial`; only `total` definitions may be `matured`
  (promoted stable). A mis-classification gates packaging, **never meaning** — the runtime clocks effects
  exactly as it clocks `Fix` (the same gate-not-meaning discipline).

  > **Note (2026-06-18 — append-only; RFC-0017 Accepted):** "only `total` definitions may be `matured`"
  > now reads **over the matured scope** (RFC-0017 §4.2): maturation is declared at nodule/phylum/program
  > scope, so the obligation becomes — every reachable non-`thaw` definition in a matured scope must be
  > `total` *and* pass the RFC-0004 §4 stable-component checks. This is the **same obligation, universally
  > quantified** over the scope — not a new or weaker one. The budget/effect interaction and the
  > `EffectBudgetExhausted` semantics described here are **unchanged**; the totality checker still
  > classifies per-definition, and a `thaw` definition is excluded from the matured set (it carries no
  > totality obligation from maturation, and runs on the fuel-guarded interpreter as usual). The "gates
  > packaging, never meaning" discipline applies at scope granularity exactly as it did per-definition.
- **Honesty (VR-5).** Per I2, recovery never fabricates or upgrades a guarantee; a fallback is honestly
  tagged. The effect/recovery subsystem *reports* bounds and outcomes; it never launders a weaker guarantee
  into a stronger one.

### 4.8 Isolation & implementation boundary (separable; KC-3)

- **A separable subsystem with a bounded blast radius (SoC).** Recovery and effects are **not** woven into
  the kernel or into RFC-0013's renderer. Errors propagate through RFC-0001's existing value mechanism;
  explicit handling elaborates to L0 `Match` (§4.3 — no new kernel node); reified policies are RFC-0005
  artifacts. The **only** runtime addition is **effect-budget enforcement**, which lives where fuel/depth
  budgets already live (RFC-0004/0008 execution, DN-05 budget resolution) — *outside* the trusted kernel
  calculus. So adding (or later changing) recovery cannot destabilise the kernel, the differential, or the
  diagnostics layer.
- **Design goal: minimal/no new L0 node.** v0 has **zero** new L0 nodes (recovery = error sums +
  `Match` + runtime budget policy). Whether effect-budget enforcement needs *any* kernel-visible hook is
  **resolved** (§8, maintainer 2026-06-16): **none** — it is entirely a runtime/checker concern (KC-3),
  mirroring how the totality checker lives outside the trusted base.

### 4.9 Relationship to RFC-0013 (presentation vs. recovery)

RFC-0013 and RFC-0014 are deliberately **two subsystems over one error**:

- **RFC-0013 presents** an error (graded levels, dual human/JSON projection, message/tags/route) — and
  **never changes control flow** (its I1: additive presentation).
- **RFC-0014 recovers from / acts on** an error (fallback, retry, escalate, cleanup) — explicitly and
  boundedly.
- They **share** the error-class registry (RFC-0013 §4.5) and the reified-policy pattern (RFC-0005), but a
  diagnostic policy and a recovery policy are **distinct artifacts**. A recovery outcome is *presented* via
  RFC-0013; RFC-0014 does not re-implement presentation. **RFC-0014 does not weaken RFC-0013's I1** — it
  generalises "additive" from *presentation* to *control*: a handler acts explicitly and either recovers or
  re-propagates, but the error never silently vanishes.

## 5. Verification (per CONTRIBUTING — which FR/NFR/VR/SC, and how)

This RFC advances **SC-3** (transparent, non-black-box control), **G2** (never-silent), **VR-5** (honest
guarantees), and **NFR-2 / SC-5b** (semantic feedback — recovery acts on the same structured error the
feedback loop consumes). When the subsystem lands, the invariants I1–I5 are verified by:

- **Never-silent recovery invariant (I1) — the central test.** A property test asserting that for a corpus
  of errors and *any* recovery policy/handler, the error is **either explicitly recovered (consumed by a
  total-over-its-cases match) or re-propagated** — never dropped. A mutant handler that silently discards an
  unmatched error is caught.
- **Bounded-overrun-is-explicit test (I4).** For each budgeted effect (retry/cascade/alloc/time), exceeding
  the budget yields an explicit `EffectBudgetExhausted` (a structured error), never a hang, stack overflow,
  or OOM — the analogue of the existing `FuelExhausted`/`DepthLimit` tests (RFC-0007 §4.5, M-347, DN-05).
- **No-undeclared-effect test (I3).** A definition performing an effect absent from its signature is an
  explicit checker error; a caller's view of callee effects is exact.
- **Honest-guarantee test (I2/VR-5).** A fallback/recovered value carries an honest (downgrade-only)
  guarantee; recovery never upgrades a bound.
- **Totality-under-budgets test (§4.7).** A bounded-effect recovering definition classifies `total`; the
  gate is packaging, not meaning.
- **Three-way differential where it touches L0 (NFR-7).** Explicit handling, elaborating to `Match` over
  error sums, runs on the L1-eval ≡ elaborate→L0-interp ≡ AOT differential like any data/recursion program.

## 6. Drawbacks

- **It is the riskiest surface in the project** — control flow over errors is exactly where a black box
  could creep in. Mitigated by making I1 (never-silent) and I3–I5 (declared/bounded/opt-in) **normative
  invariants**, by keeping the subsystem **separable** (§4.8) so a mistake is contained, and by reusing the
  proven budget discipline rather than inventing new unbounded machinery.
- **An effect-annotation system is real surface and real cognitive load** (KISS/YAGNI cost). Mitigated by a
  **coarse** v0 (a declared effect *set*, manual not inferred) with richer effect typing explicitly deferred
  (§8/§9), and by the payoff: no unknown/unbounded effects.
- **Declared effects can be verbose** (every effectful function annotates). Accepted as the price of "no
  unknown side effects"; ergonomic sugar (effect aliases, defaulting) is a future possibility (§9), never a
  way to *hide* an effect.
- **Two policy kinds (diagnostic + recovery) over one error** could confuse. Mitigated by the strict §4.9
  split and by `EXPLAIN` always naming which policy did what.

## 7. Prior art

> These were recorded as **design inspirations** at drafting; **as of 2026-06-16 they are traced into
> the evidence base** — see **Research Record 05** (`research/05-error-recovery-and-bounded-effects-RECORD.md`,
> findings T5.1–T5.6), which discharges the §8 grounding obligation. The strongest claims (bounded
> cascades, the budget generalisation) rest on *verified* grounding (Erlang/OTP max-restart-intensity;
> Mycelium's own ratified fuel/depth/DN-05 budgets); the substrate and effect-reification postures are
> grounded with honest *deltas* (Mycelium's never-silent rule is stricter than Result/`?`; v0 takes only
> a coarse bounded subset of algebraic effects, not general resumable handlers).

- **Result/`?` error values** (Rust, Swift, Go) — errors as explicit, propagating values matched at explicit
  sites; the substrate posture (§4.1/§4.3). Mycelium's never-silent rule is stricter (no silent drop).
- **Algebraic effects & handlers** (Koka, Eff, OCaml 5) — effects as a typed, handled capability; the
  inspiration for *declared, reified* effects (§4.5/§4.6). v0 is far simpler (coarse declared set, bounded
  actions), with full effect handlers/rows as a possible future (§9).
- **Erlang/OTP supervision** — *bounded* restart strategies (max-restart-intensity over a window): the
  canonical example of a **declared, bounded cascade** (a restart storm is capped, not unbounded). Direct
  grounding for I4/I5 (bounded cascades).
- **Structured concurrency cancellation** (nurseries / scopes) — effects and failures bounded to an explicit
  scope; the inspiration for "tightly scoped by default" (I5). Relevant once RFC-0008 concurrency lands.
- **Capability-based effect control** — effects available only where a capability is passed; an alternative
  to annotations for "no ambient effects," noted for the §8 effect-mechanism question.
- **Mycelium's own budget idiom** (RFC-0007 §4.5 fuel; M-347 depth; DN-05 resolved budgets) — the in-repo
  precedent that bounded effects directly generalise (the strongest, already-grounded basis).

## 8. Unresolved questions

- **Effect mechanism — RESOLVED (maintainer, 2026-06-16): declared annotations (coarse set).** v0 uses
  **declared effect annotations** — a coarse effect *set* on a signature (§4.5 I3) — not capabilities and
  not a hybrid. Rationale: it is the simplest mechanism that delivers "no unknown side effects" (KISS/YAGNI),
  matches the §4.5 draft, and keeps the surface (RFC-0006) small. Capabilities (passed tokens) and richer
  effect typing remain recorded **future possibilities** (§9), explicitly *additive* — they may extend, never
  weaken, I3–I5.
- **Any kernel-visible hook? — RESOLVED (maintainer, 2026-06-16): none.** Effect-budget enforcement is
  **entirely a runtime/checker concern** — **zero** new L0 nodes (KC-3). Recovery elaborates to L0 `Match`
  over error sums (§4.3); budget enforcement lives where fuel/depth budgets already live (RFC-0004/0008,
  DN-05, §4.8), *outside* the trusted kernel — mirroring how the totality checker lives outside the trusted
  base. The trusted kernel gains no effect/budget marker.
- **Budget vocabulary & composition — RESOLVED (maintainer, 2026-06-16): separate named budgets, one
  enforcement mechanism.** Each effect kind keeps its **own named, `EXPLAIN`-able budget** (`retry`'s
  `max_attempts`, `cascade`'s `max_depth`, `alloc`'s memory ceiling, a `time`-bearing effect's fuel-style
  clock — distinct vocabulary, not collapsed into one number), but **all are resolved and enforced by the
  single existing budget machinery** that already clocks the `Fix`/`FixGroup` fuel and the M-347 depth
  ceiling and resolves DN-05 dynamic budgets. So effect budgets *compose alongside* fuel + depth in the same
  runtime/DN-05 plumbing (shared mechanism), rather than coupling those established clocks into one shared
  budget abstraction. Each overrun is its own explicit, graceful `EffectBudgetExhausted` (§4.5 I4).
- **Effect inference vs. manual declaration — RESOLVED v0 (maintainer, 2026-06-16).**
  v0 is **manual declaration only** — explicit is honest, no inference (an effect set is *written* on
  the signature). To keep that from being a correctness hole rather than just verbose, the checker
  **composes declared effects as a *check*, not an inference**: a definition calling an effectful
  callee must itself declare (a superset of) the callee's effects, or it is an explicit
  `UndeclaredEffect` error (I3). That is *checking* that declared effects compose up the call graph —
  it never *infers* (synthesises) an undeclared effect, so an effect can still never become implicit.
  Computing a minimal effect set (true inference) is deferred to §9; the v0 line is **manual-declare +
  compositional-check**.
- **Recovery-action set — RESOLVED v0 (maintainer, 2026-06-16).** The v0 set is
  **closed and complete for v0**: `fallback(value)` (recover — explicit, honestly-tagged value, I2),
  `retry(<=N)` (re-attempt — bounded, I4), `escalate(class')` (transform + re-propagate), and
  `cleanup_then_propagate(effect)` (act, then let the error continue — additive). These cover the four
  canonical error-driven behaviours, and **each is provably never-silent** (every action yields either
  an explicit success or a re-propagated error — I1) **and bounded** (the only re-attempting action,
  `retry`, carries `<=N`). **User-defined recovery actions are NOT admitted in v0** (YAGNI) — they are a
  §9 future. When added, a user action is a function `Err(ε) -> Result<τ>` that **must** be total over
  the error's cases (I1) and **declare + bound** any effect it performs (I3/I4) — i.e. it inherits the
  same obligations as the built-in set; it is never a privileged escape hatch.
- **Concurrency interaction (RFC-0008) — RESOLVED in RFC-0008 §4.7 (M-356, 2026-06-16); single-task v0
  boundary now LIFTED, additively.** The deferral below fixed a *safe* single-task boundary; **RFC-0008
  §4.7** now lifts it without weakening any invariant here. The composition (designed there, enacted as
  scheduler-independent primitives in `mycelium_interp::supervise`): **per-task budgets** — each task
  instances its own M-353 ledger, so an overrun is an *in-that-task* `EffectBudgetExhausted` (I4), never
  global; **cooperative cancellation** — observed at budget-check points, an explicit *additive*
  `Cancelled` (I1), never preemptive; **cross-task failure propagation** — an explicit `TaskOutcome`
  with no silent/dropped variant, so a child failure is a value the parent must act on (I1 across the
  boundary); and **`reclaim` bounded-cascade supervision** — a restart storm bounded on **both** the
  `cascade` effect budget (I4/I5) **and** a windowed max-restart-intensity (logical clock; Erlang/OTP,
  Research Record 05 T5.3), exceeding either an explicit escalation (a declared, bounded cascade — I5),
  never unbounded. The actual task **scheduler** and the RT2 differential are RFC-0008 R1 (M-357), built
  on these primitives. *Everything stays additive over the explicit error (I1) and declared + bounded
  (I3/I4): no spooky cross-task action, no unbounded cascade.* The original (now-superseded) deferral is
  preserved below, append-only.
  - *(superseded 2026-06-16 — original deferral)* v0 recovery/effects are **single-task / synchronous**:
    budgets are per-evaluation (the same scope the `Fix` fuel clock already uses), and there is **no
    cross-task effect or cascade** in v0 (no spooky action across tasks — there are no tasks yet). The
    genuinely-open composition (per-task budgets, cancellation, cross-task failure propagation) is
    **RFC-0008's** design, and it must compose **additively**: a task failure is an explicit error
    subject to I1, a per-task budget overrun is an in-that-task `EffectBudgetExhausted`. Fixing the v0
    boundary now makes the deferral *safe* (v0 cannot accidentally admit an unbounded cross-task
    cascade) rather than merely postponed.
- **Handler composition & re-entrancy — RESOLVED v0 (maintainer, 2026-06-16).**
  - **Nesting is lexical and deterministic.** Handlers nest like `Match`: the **innermost** handling
    site whose pattern matches an error handles it; an unmatched case **re-propagates** to the next
    enclosing site (never dropped — I1). No ambiguity, no ordering surprises.
  - **A handler may itself be effectful — and is then declared + budgeted like any other code** (I3/I4):
    a handler is *not* a privileged effect-free or budget-free zone (a `cleanup_then_propagate` that
    allocates declares `alloc(<=…)`).
  - **A cascade (a handler that triggers a further error) is bounded by an explicit `cascade(max_depth)`
    budget** (I4/I5); overrun is `EffectBudgetExhausted`, never unbounded handler recursion. Cascade
    *ordering* is just the deterministic innermost-first propagation above.
  - This makes composition deterministic, never-silent, and bounded with **no machinery beyond** the
    declared + budgeted-effects discipline already in §4.5.
- **Research grounding (§7) — DONE (2026-06-16).** The prior art is traced into `research/` (Research
  Record 05, T5.1–T5.6), discharging this obligation; the externals were verified by web search and the
  in-repo budget precedent confirmed. The *remaining* open questions above are design choices, not
  grounding gaps.

## 9. Future possibilities

- **Richer effect typing** — effect rows / polymorphism / inference, *only* if it never lets an effect
  become implicit or unbounded (would extend, not weaken, I3–I5).
- **User-defined recovery actions & effect kinds** — an extensible, still-reified, still-bounded set.
- **Capability-passing effects** — effects granted by explicit capability tokens (no-ambient-effects via
  capabilities), as an alternative or complement to annotations.
- **Effect/recovery ergonomics** — effect aliases, scoped defaults, and `?`-chaining sugar that reduce
  verbosity *without* hiding an effect or a budget.
- **Automatic baseline recovery profiles** (DynEL's *automated baseline* intent) — named, **opt-in**,
  **declared + bounded** recovery profiles (e.g. `resilient`/`strict`) the automation layer applies only
  when a developer opts in, plus auto-generated handler *skeletons* — for boilerplate QoL without ever an
  implicit control-flow change (I3/I4/I5 hold; never-silent I1 preserved). Designed in **RFC-0015
  (Automatic Baseline Diagnostics & Recovery)**, which generates/applies this RFC's policies without
  weakening its invariants (append-only). Tracked M-362.
- **Stdlib `result`/`effect` module** (M-346) — the recovery combinators and the standard error/effect kinds
  as a self-contained, dogfoodable core-library citizen.
- **Self-hosting** — the recovery/effect runtime eventually written in Mycelium-lang, consuming its own
  bounded-effect machinery.

## Meta — changelog

- **2026-06-18 — Append-only note to §4.7 (RFC-0017 Accepted): maturation is now a scope attribute.**
  Added an inline note to §4.7 recording that "only `total` definitions may be `matured`" now reads
  **over the matured scope** (RFC-0017 §4.2): every reachable non-`thaw` definition in a matured
  nodule/phylum/program must be `total` and pass RFC-0004 §4 stable-component checks. The obligation
  is the **same, universally quantified** — the budget/effect interaction (I4), `EffectBudgetExhausted`
  semantics, and "gates packaging, never meaning" discipline are **unchanged**. `thaw` definitions are
  excluded from the matured set and carry no totality obligation from maturation. No normative content
  altered. Append-only.
- **2026-06-16 — §8 concurrency deferral RESOLVED; single-task boundary lifted (M-356; RFC-0008 §4.7).**
  The §8 concurrency interaction — the last RFC-0008-tied deferral — is resolved in **RFC-0008 §4.7**:
  per-task budgets (each task instances its own M-353 ledger; an overrun is an *in-that-task*
  `EffectBudgetExhausted`), cooperative **additive** cancellation (an explicit `Cancelled`, never
  preemptive — I1), cross-task failure propagation via an explicit `TaskOutcome` with no silent/dropped
  variant (I1 across the boundary), and `reclaim` **bounded-cascade** supervision bounded on *both* the
  `cascade` effect budget (I4/I5) and a windowed max-restart-intensity (logical clock; Erlang/OTP,
  Record 05 T5.3) — exceeding either an explicit escalation, never a storm. Enacted as
  scheduler-independent primitives in `mycelium_interp::supervise` (no L0 node — KC-3; the trusted base
  stays sequential), composed with the recovery driver in `tests/recover.rs`. Everything stays additive
  over the explicit error (I1) and declared + bounded (I3/I4). The task **scheduler** + RT2 differential
  are RFC-0008 R1 (M-357). `just check` green. Append-only.
- **2026-06-16 — §4.8 integration completed (M-353; RFC-0008 Accepted).** The deferred half of §4.8 —
  *wiring the `Budgets` ledger into the runtime/AOT env-machine's budget enforcement* — is enacted. The
  ledger primitive (`EffectKind`/`EffectBudget`/`EffectBudgetExhausted`/`Budgets`) is **lifted into
  `mycelium-interp`** (`mycelium_interp::budget`), the common ancestor both the recovery subsystem
  (`mycelium-lsp`) and the env-machine (`mycelium-mlir`) depend on — the *shared budget-resolution
  surface* §8 anticipated, placed to avoid a crate cycle and to sit where the fuel clock already lives
  (no kernel change — KC-3, **no** new L0 node, **no** kernel hook). An overrun now routes through
  **`mycelium_interp::EvalError::EffectBudget`** — the effect sibling of `FuelExhausted`/`DepthLimit` on
  the **one runtime refusal channel** (§8: *separate named budgets, one enforcement mechanism*): a
  budgeted effect overruns *gracefully at runtime exactly as recursion does*, never a hang/OOM (I4). The
  env-machine threads the *same* ledger (`run_core_with_effects`) and charges a declared **`alloc`**
  budget per control-stack frame (the opt-in sibling of the DN-05 depth ceiling, same per-frame-bytes
  basis) — absent ⇒ unchanged behaviour (I5 opt-in); the `retry`/`cascade` budgets are spent by the
  recovery *driver* over that same ledger and channel. Verified: the **bounded-overrun-is-explicit test
  extended to the runtime path** (`mycelium-mlir`: a declared `alloc` budget overruns as
  `EvalError::EffectBudget`, an absent one leaves behaviour identical) and a **meaning-preserving
  three-way differential** where it touches L0 (`mycelium-l1`: threading an ample ledger is
  observable-transparent on the recovery `Match`, NFR-7). This **completes RFC-0014 §4.8**; the
  *concurrency* composition (§8 — per-task ledgers on this seam) remains RFC-0008's, now in progress
  (M-355). `just check` green. Append-only.
- **2026-06-16 — Accepted + Enacted (M-352).** Maintainer ratified `Draft → Accepted` (approving the
  draft and all §8 dispositions — the four proposed v0 dispositions below move from *sign-off pending* to
  normative) and approved proceeding. The §4 design is enacted as a **separable, tooling-layer** subsystem
  in `crates/mycelium-lsp/src/recover` (no kernel change — KC-3, zero new L0 nodes; no Python — ADR-007):
  `error` (the result-sum `Outcome` over a structured error reusing RFC-0013's shared `ClassRegistry` —
  X1, no `eval`); `effect` (the closed `EffectKind` set + per-kind named `EffectBudget`, the `Budgets`
  ledger whose overrun is an explicit, graceful `EffectBudgetExhausted` — I4, and the compositional
  `check_effects` no-undeclared-effect check — I3); `policy` (the reified `on <ErrorClass> => <action>`
  recovery policy, closed action set `fallback`/`retry`/`escalate`/`cleanup_then_propagate`,
  content-addressed `PolicyRef`); and `handle` (the never-silent driver — every error is **recovered**
  with an honestly-tagged value or **re-propagated**, never dropped — I1; a fallback carries an honest,
  downgrade-only guarantee — I2/VR-5). Verified by `crates/mycelium-lsp/tests/recover.rs` (RFC-0014 §5):
  the central **never-silent recovery invariant** (a corpus of errors × every action yields Recovered or
  Propagated, never a drop — I1), the **bounded-overrun-is-explicit** test (a budgeted effect overrun is
  `EffectBudgetExhausted`, never a hang/OOM — I4), the **no-undeclared-effect** test (I3), the
  **honest-guarantee** test (I2/VR-5), and the **opt-in default scope** test (I5). The
  **L0-`Match`-over-error-sums** lowering target — "recovery introduces no new kernel node" — is
  differentially verified in `mycelium-l1` (`recovery_match_over_a_result_sum_agrees_three_ways`):
  a `Result = Ok | Err` match runs identically on L1-eval ≡ elaborate→L0-interp ≡ AOT (NFR-7).
  **Out of v0 scope (honest boundary):** wiring the `Budgets` ledger into the AOT env-machine's runtime
  budget resolver is the RFC-0008 integration (the §4.8 boundary), tracked separately; v0 delivers the
  reified mechanism + semantics + invariants. `just check` green. Append-only.
- **2026-06-16 — Remaining §8 questions given proposed v0 dispositions (sign-off pending; still
  Draft).** At the maintainer's direction (draft the remaining answers before any code), the four §8
  questions left after the three gating decisions now carry concrete **proposed v0 dispositions**,
  marked *maintainer sign-off pending* (append-only — these are proposals, not yet Accepted decisions):
  (1) **effect inference** = *manual-declare + compositional-check* (the checker requires a caller to
  declare a superset of its callee's effects — `UndeclaredEffect` otherwise — but never *infers* an
  undeclared effect; true minimal-set inference deferred to §9); (2) **recovery-action set** = the
  *closed* v0 set `fallback`/`retry`/`escalate`/`cleanup_then_propagate` (each provably never-silent +
  bounded; user-defined actions are a §9 future and would inherit I1/I3/I4); (3) **concurrency** =
  *deferred to RFC-0008* with a v0 boundary fixed now (single-task / synchronous; per-evaluation
  budgets; no cross-task cascade — so the deferral is safe, not merely postponed); (4) **handler
  composition** = *lexical innermost-first* (unmatched re-propagates, never drops — I1), a handler's own
  effects are declared + budgeted like any code, and a cascade is bounded by `cascade(max_depth)`
  (overrun → `EffectBudgetExhausted`) — all with no machinery beyond §4.5. With these + the §7 prior-art
  tracing (Record 05) done, the RFC is **ready for a Draft→Accepted decision**; **no code lands until
  Accepted** (RFC-0014's gate). Append-only.
- **2026-06-16 — Three §8 design questions resolved (maintainer; still Draft).** The maintainer settled
  the three questions that gate any recovery/effects code, all on the KC-3/KISS-aligned options: (1)
  **effect mechanism = declared annotations, coarse set** (not capabilities, not hybrid — capabilities/
  effect-rows stay additive future possibilities, §9); (2) **no kernel-visible hook** — effect-budget
  enforcement is entirely a runtime/checker concern, zero new L0 nodes (§4.8); (3) **separate named budgets,
  one enforcement mechanism** — each effect kind keeps its own `EXPLAIN`-able budget vocabulary but all are
  resolved/enforced by the existing DN-05 budget machinery that already clocks `Fix`/`FixGroup` fuel and the
  M-347 depth ceiling (composed alongside, not collapsed into one number). §8/§4.8 and the status line record
  the dispositions. The RFC **stays Draft** — the remaining §8 questions (recovery-action set, effect
  inference, concurrency, handler composition) and the §7 prior-art tracing into `research/` are still open
  before Accepted; **no code lands until then.** Append-only.
- **2026-06-16 — Draft (Proposed).** Created at the maintainer's request to capture the **declarative error
  recovery & bounded-effects** subsystem that RFC-0013 §8/§9 deferred (the DN04-Q1 recovery half). Designs
  three pillars: **errors-as-propagating-values** (the RFC-0001 substrate; G2), **explicit declarative
  recovery** (an explicit handling site that elaborates to L0 `Match` — KC-3, no new kernel node — plus a
  reified RFC-0005-pattern recovery policy), and **declared, bounded effects** (effects named on signatures,
  every unbounded effect budgeted with an *explicit, graceful* `EffectBudgetExhausted` overrun — the direct
  generalisation of the `Fix`/`FixGroup` fuel clock, M-347 depth ceiling, and DN-05 budgets). Records the
  maintainer's governing discipline: errors propagate/bubble and **trigger functionality**; effects and even
  cascades are allowed **when explicitly declared/implemented** so they stay *known and bounded* — the enemy
  is *unintended/unknown/unbounded* effects, not effects per se; default tightly scoped, broader opt-in by
  explicit declaration; recovery is **additive over** the explicit error (never silent — G2; never fabricates
  or upgrades a guarantee — VR-5). Defines the **isolation** boundary (a separable subsystem; budget
  enforcement lives with RFC-0004/0008/DN-05, not the kernel — KC-3) and the **RFC-0013 split** (presentation
  vs. recovery; shared registry/pattern; this RFC does not weaken RFC-0013's additive-presentation invariant).
  Prior art (Result/`?`, algebraic effects, **Erlang/OTP bounded supervision**, structured-concurrency
  cancellation, capabilities, and Mycelium's own budget idiom) is recorded as **design inspiration not yet
  traced to `research/`** — tracing it is a pre-ratification task. Advances SC-3, G2, VR-5, NFR-2/SC-5b;
  verification = a never-silent recovery invariant test (I1), a bounded-overrun-is-explicit test (I4), a
  no-undeclared-effect test (I3), an honest-guarantee test (I2/VR-5), a totality-under-budgets test, and the
  three-way differential where recovery touches L0 (NFR-7). **No code lands with this draft** — many design
  choices (the effect mechanism, the budget vocabulary, any kernel hook) are explicit open questions (§8);
  ratification (Draft → Accepted) and a tracking milestone are the maintainer's, presented here first.
  Append-only. Lineage: DN04-Q1 → RFC-0013 §8/§9 → RFC-0014.
