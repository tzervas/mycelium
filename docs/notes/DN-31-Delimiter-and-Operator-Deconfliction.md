# Design Note DN-31 — Delimiter & Operator Deconfliction (`<> () [] {}`, return arrow, trit literals)

| Field | Value |
|---|---|
| **Note** | DN-31 |
| **Status** | **Draft** (2026-06-24; direction capture — advisory, non-committal) |
| **Feeds** | a binding **supersession of RFC-0019 §4.1** (type-parameter bracket) + an update to **RFC-0030** (concrete L3 grammar) + **RFC-0025** (resolves the deferred angle-bracket operators, **M-745**); touches RFC-0001/RFC-0033 (repr-descriptor surface) and the lexer/parser/conformance corpus. |
| **Date** | June 24, 2026 |
| **Decides** | *Nothing normatively* — advisory. Records the maintainer's decided delimiter/operator scheme (2026-06-24): free the **triple-loaded `<>`** to comparison/shift operators only, move type/size arguments onto the **near-empty `[]`**, and reconcile the four bracket families + the return arrow + trit literals into one collision-free allocation. The binding change is a future RFC/supersession; this note captures the scheme + the grounding + the open questions. |
| **Task** | surface syntax (pre-RFC capture); resolves M-745 |

> **Posture (transparency rule / VR-5).** Advisory. **Enacts nothing; moves no status; rewrites no Enacted
> decision.** RFC-0019 §4.1 (Enacted) committed `<…>` for type parameters; this note proposes to **supersede**
> that (the append-only way), not edit it. No claim here is upgraded past `Declared` until the binding RFC lands.

## §1 The problem — measured, not asserted

A grep of the normative grammar (`docs/spec/grammar/mycelium.ebnf`) shows the load is badly imbalanced:

| Delimiter | Current roles (grounded) | Verdict |
|---|---|---|
| **`<>`** | type params (L109) · type args (L147) · **trit literals** `<+-0>` (L252) · **and** the *wanted* comparison/shift operators `< > <= >= << >>` (deferred by RFC-0025 §4.3, **M-745**) | **triple-loaded → the clunkiness** |
| `()` | call/constructor args, grouping, swap/spore (L110/115/185/195/235/239) | heavily used, clean |
| `{}` | trait/match/wild/colony bodies, effects `!{…}`, **repr descriptors** `Binary{8}` (L135-139), ambient | loaded, positionally distinct |
| **`[]`** | list literals only (L248) | **near-empty → free capacity** |

The `<>` overload is *why* M-745 (the comparison/shift operators) is blocked: `a < b` cannot be told from
`f<T>(x)` without contextual lexing or speculative parsing. The fix is to **rebalance off `<>` onto `[]`**, not
to add disambiguation machinery to keep `<>` triple-booked.

## §2 The decided allocation

```
<>   comparison/shift operators ONLY:  <   >   <<   >>
       (the <= >= glyphs are RETIRED → word operators `lte` `gte`)
()   calls · grouping · tuples · constructors
[]   type arguments · sized/repr types · list literals   (List[T], Binary[64], [1,2,3])
       — disambiguated by position (type/operand position vs standalone value position)
{}   blocks · effects !{…} · match bodies · MAP literals
->   retired as the return arrow  →  =>   (bare `=` `-` `>` remain independent operators)
```

Trit literals leave `<>` for a **`0t` literal prefix** (like `0x`/`0b`): `0t+-0`. Repr/size types use `[]`:
`trit[N]`, `tryte[9]`, `Binary[64]`, `Ternary[N]` — and the pattern **extends to bytes** (`byte[N]`).

**Why this works:** `<>` drops from three roles to one (operators) — M-745 dissolves with *no* disambiguation
machinery. `[]` absorbs the type/size args it has spare capacity for; its only ambiguity (type-args vs list
literal) is a clean **position** split, tractable here *specifically because* Mycelium has **no `arr[i]`
indexing** (it's `get(seq, i)`) and **no juxtaposition application** (calls are `()`), so `name[…]` is
unambiguously type/size args and a standalone `[…]` is a list. The maintainer has accepted the position rule
("parser handles type vs value position").

## §3 What this supersedes / touches

- **RFC-0019 §4.1 (Enacted)** — `type_params`/`type_args` move `<…>` → `[…]`. *Supersede, don't rewrite.*
- **RFC-0025 §4.3 / M-745** — the deferred ordering/shift operators become *defined* (`<>` is operators-only;
  `<=`/`>=` are `lte`/`gte` words). M-745 is **resolved by this scheme**, not by speculative parsing.
- **RFC-0030** — the concrete L3 grammar is regenerated (`type_args`, `base_type` repr descriptors, `TritLit`,
  the `fn_sig`/`fn_item` return arrow, `ListLit` vs type-args).
- **RFC-0001 / RFC-0033** — repr-descriptor surface `Binary{8}` → `Binary[64]` (the `{}`→`[]` move); the value
  model's *surface* changes, not its semantics or content-hash (the descriptor's *meaning* is unchanged).
- **Lexer/parser** (`crates/mycelium-l1`) + the **conformance corpus** + the **editor grammars** (`just
  grammar-gen`) + the **doc-index**. A mechanical but wide migration.

## §4 Open questions — the real tensions (don't paper over them)

1. **`{}` is now blocks *and* maps — the empty case is ambiguous.** `{ e }` (block) vs `{ k: v }` (map) split
   on `:` pairs, but **`{}` (empty)** is an empty block *or* an empty map. Needs a rule (a typed context, or a
   distinct empty-map spelling e.g. `[:]`/`Map[]`). **This is the sharpest open question** — it's the JS
   block-vs-object-literal problem; resolve it before the grammar commits. *(Flagged on merit — the scheme as
   stated does not yet disambiguate empty `{}`.)*
2. **`[]` carries type-args *and* sized/repr types *and* lists.** In *type* position `Name[…]` is uniformly
   "bracketed type/size params" (so `Binary[64]` and `List[T]` are the *same* form — fine); in *value* position
   `[…]` is a list. The residual edge is a **list literal at statement start right after an expression on the
   prior line** — newline/terminator handling must make `expr` ⏎ `[…]` unambiguous. Bounded, but specify it.
3. **`<=`/`>=` → `lte`/`gte` is asymmetric with `<`/`>`.** Mycelium already treats `a < b` as infix sugar for
   `lt(a, b)`; keeping `<`/`>` as glyph sugar but spelling `<=`/`>=` as words is defensible (those glyphs are
   the most type-arg-ambiguous) but worth stating explicitly so it reads as intentional, not an omission.
4. **Migration is wide and the corpus is the product.** Every `<T>`, `Binary{8}`, `<+-0>`, and `->` in the
   spec, examples, conformance corpus, and (small) code must move together — a single coordinated change, not a
   drip. Cheap *now* (design phase, ~no ecosystem); expensive later. Sequence it as one supersession wave.

## §5 Definition of Done (this note)

A binding RFC (or an RFC-0019 supersession + RFC-0030/0025 update) ratifies §2, with §4-Q1 (empty `{}`)
and §4-Q2 (list-at-statement-start) **resolved with explicit disambiguation rules** before the grammar commits.
This note **enacts nothing** (VR-5/G2); it is the direction record + the grounding, superseded (append-only) by
that act.
