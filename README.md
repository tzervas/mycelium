# Mycelium

> A programming language that treats **traditional binary**, **balanced ternary**, **dense embeddings**, and **Vector Symbolic Architectures (VSA / hyperdimensional computing)** as co-equal, first-class substrates — under semantics that are **transparent** (no hidden behavior), **metadata-native**, and **amenable to formal reasoning**.

**Status:** design + **Rust-first implementation underway.** The design corpus is Accepted/Resolved
(Foundation, RFC-0001…0021, ADR-001…017, DN-01…14), and the kernel is landing as a
Rust workspace of **43 crates** (+ `xtask`) <!-- doc-currency:crate-count --> — a trusted reference interpreter, certified binary↔ternary
swaps, the selection-policy engine, and a Rust-first standard library. Phases **0–3, 5, and 7** are
complete; Phases **4, 6, and 8** are in progress. Per the honesty rule, the 23 Rust-first stdlib
specs were **ratified to `Accepted`** (2026-06-20, DN-07) only on a checked basis (guarantee
matrices asserted in tests) — `runtime` and `self-hosting-readiness` stay `Draft` (gate-pending),
and self-hosting (M-502) is **not yet established**. See [Status & open items](#status--open-items).

## Why this exists

Modern computing keeps these four representations in separate worlds: bits for traditional computation, embeddings for ML, hypervectors for symbolic-connectionist work, and balanced ternary as a recurring "what if" in hardware. Moving between them is where correctness quietly leaks — conversions are implicit, lossy in undocumented ways, and impossible to audit.

Mycelium's thesis is that the **representation-swap** should be the explicit, verifiable, first-class operation of the language. The central design problem is therefore **metadata-native, explicit, verifiable swapping between substrates** — with every approximation disclosed, bounded, and tagged by how trustworthy that bound is.

Three non-negotiables shape every decision:
1. **No hidden / opaque behavior** in core semantics.
2. **Human-intelligible *and* useful for AI agents** (a dual-intelligibility goal).
3. **Formally reasoning-amenable** — "no black boxes" is realized as mechanically-checkable invariants, not a slogan.

---

## The core ideas (in one screen)

- **Representation is part of the type.** `Binary{width}`, `Ternary{trits}`, `Dense{dim,dtype}`, `VSA{model,dim,sparsity}` are distinct type families. There is **no implicit conversion** between paradigms.
- **`Swap` is the only representation-changing operation**, and every swap emits a **certificate** describing exactly what the conversion cost.
- **Honesty is a typed, monotone property.** A guarantee lattice — **`Exact ⊐ Proven ⊐ Empirical ⊐ Declared`** — travels with every value and degrades by *meet* through operations, so a disclosed guarantee can never spuriously strengthen.
- **Metadata is self-describing and survives lowering** (Apache-Arrow-grade): provenance, bounds, layout, and reconstruction info are queryable at runtime and exposed to tooling.
- **Split verification regime:** binary↔ternary swaps are *provable/bijective-within-range*; VSA/embedding swaps carry *bounded/probabilistic* per-instance certificates (translation-validation style).
- **Physical packing is a *schedule*, not a type.** Lossless layout (e.g. ternary packing) is chosen at a lowering stage and *recorded* as inspectable metadata — values of the same logical type stay interoperable whether packed or not.

## The Rust workspace

The kernel and its tooling live in `crates/` as **43 crates** (+ `xtask`), MSRV-pinned to Rust 1.92
(ADR-007). The trusted base is small and the public surface is gated by a committed API baseline
(`docs/spec/api/`, KC-3). Grouped by role:

- **Kernel / trusted base** — `mycelium-core` (Core IR: `Value`/`Repr`/`Meta`, the guarantee
  lattice, content-addressing), `mycelium-numerics` (the ε/δ bound kernels), `mycelium-diag` (the
  structured diagnostic record).
- **Interpreter & certification** — `mycelium-interp` (the reference interpreter — the trusted
  executable semantics), `mycelium-cert` (swap certificates + the certified binary↔ternary swap,
  Z3-backed).
- **Paradigms & selection** — `mycelium-dense`, `mycelium-vsa` (MAP-I algebra), `mycelium-select`
  (the total, EXPLAIN-able selection-policy engine).
- **Language & execution** — `mycelium-l1` (the L1 calculus + the unified swap/interp differential
  checker), `mycelium-mlir` (the AOT path: an env-machine + the direct-LLVM native lowering, JIT,
  and hot-inject; the real `ternary` MLIR dialect is in progress, M-601).
- **Toolchain (above the kernel)** — `mycelium-lsp`, `mycelium-fmt` (`mycfmt`), `mycelium-check`
  (`myc-check`), `mycelium-lint` (`myc-lint`), `mycelium-sec` (`myc-sec`), `mycelium-doc`
  (`myc-doc`), `mycelium-spore` (the `spore` packager), `mycelium-build`, `mycelium-proj`.
- **Standard library `std`** (Rings 0–2, RFC-0016) — `mycelium-std-{core, ternary, dense, vsa,
  swap, select, content, numerics, diag, recover, spore}` (Tier-A differentiators) and
  `mycelium-std-{collections, error, cmp, iter, math, text, fmt, io, fs, time, rand, testing}`
  (Tier-B commons). Each ships its RFC-0016 §4.5 guarantee matrix as data, asserted in tests.

Every operation carries an **honest, per-op guarantee tag** on the `Exact ⊐ Proven ⊐ Empirical ⊐
Declared` lattice; out-of-range is an explicit `Result`/`Option`, never a silent fallback.

## Build & checks

```
just            # list recipes
just setup      # best-effort install of the check tools
just check      # the FULL suite — exactly what CI runs (build · clippy · test · docs · proofs · supply-chain)
just fmt        # auto-format (Rust + Python)
```

Checks **skip gracefully** when a tool isn't present. Remote CI (`.github/workflows/checks.yml`) is
**manual-dispatch only and advisory**, running the same `just ci` — see `CONTRIBUTING.md`.

## Suggested reading order

1. **`docs/Doc-Index.md`** — the map: every document, its status, and how they depend on each other.
2. **`docs/Mycelium_Project_Foundation.md`** — the charter: vision, requirements (FR/NFR/VR), success & kill criteria, ADRs 001–009, roadmap, risks.
3. **`docs/rfcs/RFC-0001…`** — the Core IR & metadata schema (everything else plugs into this).
4. **RFC-0002 → RFC-0021**, then the ADRs (010…017) and design notes (DN-01…14) for the deep dives — `Doc-Index.md` orders them.
5. **`crates/mycelium-core` and `crates/mycelium-interp`** — the kernel and reference semantics, if you want to read the design as code.
6. **`research/`** — the evidence base (records 01…11), if you want the "why" behind a decision.

## Status & open items

The design corpus is Accepted and the kernel is **building**:

- ✅ **KC-1 (the existential risk) passed — and confirmed in a build.** Proven non-asymptotic VSA bundling bounds exist (Clarkson 2023; Thomas 2021), and the Liquid-Haskell `bundle` capacity-refinement probe (`proofs/lh-bundle/`, RFC-0003 §5) reports **SAFE** (Z3 discharged), ratifying the "axiomatized theorem + checked instantiation" strategy. VSA stays in core with honest `Proven` tags.
- ✅ **KC-2 / LLM leverage — verdict: proceed (DN-09).** The M-002 experiment measured *weak-but-recoverable* leverage (best arm ≈40% first-attempt → ≈70% eventual), below the "irrecoverable collapse" kill threshold. The follow-up is a committed text syntax + a co-equal projection layer (M-380; RFC-0021); the retention-ratio ablation (RP-1) stays an honest, non-blocking open research prompt.
- 🧱 **Built (Phases 0–3, 5, 7):** the Core IR + Rust reference interpreter, the single certificate checker, the certified binary↔ternary swap (Z3-proved), Dense/VSA breadth, the selection-policy engine + EXPLAIN, the **direct-LLVM native path + JIT + hot-inject** (the data/closure/tail-recursion fragment, M-373/M-378/M-379), the L1 calculus, the runtime/concurrency model (RFC-0008), and the Rust-first standard library — whose 23 specs are now **ratified to `Accepted`** (2026-06-20, DN-07; `runtime` + `self-hosting-readiness` stay `Draft`).
- 🔜 **In progress (Phases 4, 6, 8):** the full interpreted↔compiled ABI + AOT env-machine (mutual recursion, RFC-0012 ambient); the **real `ternary`→arith/vector→LLVM MLIR-dialect lowering** (M-601, E6-1 — replacing the textual stand-in; **unblocked** now that libMLIR is provisionable on Linux, M-348) + deployable spores; and the remaining toolchain/release-engineering gates.
- ❓ **Not yet established:** **self-hosting (M-502)** — the stdlib is Rust-first; the Mycelium-lang migration half is open, and `runtime` / `self-hosting-readiness` stay `Draft` (gate-pending). The native MLIR-dialect verdict (M-601/M-602) stays honestly "not established" until the lowering lands and the three-way differential holds (VR-5), never pre-written.

Residual risks tracked in the Foundation risk register, notably **RR-13** (HRR/FHRR are the VSA weak link). See `docs/Mycelium_Project_Foundation.md` §10 for the dependency-ordered action list and `docs/planning/phase-*.md` for the live phase ladder.

## Technology stack

- **Kernel + reference interpreter:** Rust (MSRV **1.92**, ADR-007). The interpreter is the trusted base and the reference semantics (`crates/mycelium-interp`).
- **AOT path:** **MLIR → LLVM** (`crates/mycelium-mlir`), confined to the performance path. Built: the env-machine + the **direct-LLVM** native lowering of the data/closure/tail-recursion fragment, with JIT and hot-inject (M-373/M-378/M-379). In progress: the real `ternary`→arith/vector→LLVM **MLIR-dialect** lowering (M-601, E6-1 — currently a textual stand-in; unblocked by libMLIR provisioning on Linux, M-348). `vsa`/`embedding` dialects deferred.
- **VSA submodule:** Rust (`crates/mycelium-vsa`) — the MAP-I algebra + the per-model guarantee matrix (RFC-0003).
- **Verified numerics:** a Flocq/FloVer-style certificate-checker-in-Rust — two assurance tiers, ε (affine arithmetic) and δ (union-bound) sharing one certificate (`crates/mycelium-numerics`, ADR-010).
- **Toolchain:** Rust crates (`mycfmt` / `myc-check` / `myc-lint` / `myc-sec` / `myc-doc` / `spore`), all routed through `just check`.
- **Experiments / LLM harness:** Python **3.13 / 3.14**, **UV**, **pytest**, **codecov** (`experiments/`, `tools/llm-harness/`).
- **Proofs:** Z3/SMT2 (binary↔ternary injectivity, `proofs/binary-ternary-roundtrip/`) + Liquid Haskell (`proofs/lh-bundle/`).

## Glossary

- **Substrate / paradigm** — one of the four representation families (binary, balanced ternary, dense embedding, VSA).
- **Balanced ternary** — base-3 with digits {−1, 0, +1}; symmetric, sign-is-a-digit. Used here as a *logical* substrate, forward-compatible with native-ternary hardware.
- **VSA / HDC** — Vector Symbolic Architectures / hyperdimensional computing: high-dimensional vectors with algebraic operations (bind, bundle, permute) for symbolic-connectionist computation.
- **Swap** — the explicit, certificate-emitting operation that changes a value's representation. The only such operation.
- **Guarantee lattice** — `Exact ⊐ Proven ⊐ Empirical ⊐ Declared`: how trustworthy a value's accuracy claim is; composes by *meet* (weakest wins).
- **Certificate** — a checkable record that a swap (or a compiled artifact vs. the interpreter) meets a claimed `{ε, δ, strength}` bound.
- **Translation validation** — proving each *instance* of a lowering/conversion correct, rather than proving the whole compiler correct once.
- **Schedule-staged packing** — choosing a lossless physical layout at a lowering stage (a "schedule"), recorded as inspectable metadata, not encoded in the type.
- **`ErrorBound` / `ProbBound`** — the two ADR-010 bound kernels: error-magnitude (ε) via affine arithmetic; failure-probability (δ) via the union bound / approximate couplings.
- **Reconstruction manifest** — the explicit recipe (model, codebooks, compositional structure, decoding procedure, bound) needed to recover content from a VSA representation; distinguishes indexed retrieval from true compositional reconstruction.
- **Stable component** — a definition that is content-addressed + spec-ratified + verification-passed, and therefore eligible for AOT compilation.

## Conventions for contributing

> Full detail (process, dev environment, workflow) is in [`CONTRIBUTING.md`](./CONTRIBUTING.md). In brief:

- **Decisions are append-only.** Don't silently edit an ADR/RFC decision — supersede it with a new status (`Draft/Proposed → Accepted → Superseded`) and link forward. Every claim cites its grounding (survey labels `G*`/`A–E`/`R*`; research labels `T0.x/T1.x/T2.x`).
- **Honesty rule.** Guarantee tags are assigned **per model and per operation**, never in aggregate. A bound may be tagged `Proven` *only* if it cites a theorem whose side-conditions are checked; otherwise it is `Empirical` (validated) or `Declared` (user-asserted, always flagged). New results may *upgrade* a tag; absence keeps it weaker.
- **No black boxes.** Any feature that introduces opaque behavior (especially "intelligent" automatic selection) must be reified, inspectable, and explainable (`EXPLAIN`).
- **Engineering principles** (the project's house style): SRP, OCP, LSP, ISP, DIP, DRY, KISS, YAGNI, Law of Demeter, separation of concerns; **composition over inheritance**; PEP 8 / Black for Python.
- **Squash-only into `main`.** Every PR lands as a single curated squash commit (a clean linear, bisectable history); internal swarm integration merges (leaf→epic→orch) stay octopus/`--no-ff` to preserve lineage. The `/land` skill drives the autonomous self-review → green `just check` → curated squash-merge → cleanup loop.
- **Kill criteria** (KC-1…KC-4) are re-checked at every phase gate; a gate that doesn't check them is hiding risk.

## Provenance & evidence

Everything in `docs/` traces back to the research passes recorded in `research/` — now **eleven records** (`01…11`), spanning the prior-art survey and T0/T1/T2 findings through the language layer, runtime/concurrency, error-recovery & bounded effects, automatic-baseline diagnostics, the narrative-authoring pipeline, honest-stdlib prior art, stage-1 grading non-interference, traits/coherence & Repr-polymorphism, and the semantic-projection framework. Each record carries its structured findings + source list; normative claims in `docs/` cite their grounding (survey labels `G*`/`A–E`/`R*`; research labels `T0.x…T11.x`) or are flagged as open questions.
