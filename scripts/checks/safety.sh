# `// SAFETY:` adjacency gate (DN-21 §5 F-3; ADR-014 §8.1): every Rust `unsafe` block / `unsafe fn` /
# `unsafe impl` / `unsafe trait` under crates/ must carry a `// SAFETY:` justification within a small
# window directly above it. ADR-014 deferred this grep as future work; M-681 lands it. Pure
# shell + `git grep` (no toolchain, no new dependency), so it always runs — it never skips on a
# missing tool. A site with no adjacent `// SAFETY:` fails loudly (G2 — never a silent pass).
#
# Honesty (VR-5): this is an `Empirical`/`Declared` regex heuristic, not a parser — the Rust source is
# ground truth. It excludes line/doc comments (so prose mentioning "unsafe" is not a hit) and the
# `unsafe_code` lint attribute (`\bunsafe\b` skips it — no whitespace before `_code`). A string literal
# containing `unsafe {` would be a false positive; none exist today (DN-21 §2 inventory = exactly 6
# sites, all real, all in crates/mycelium-mlir).
