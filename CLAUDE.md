# CLAUDE.md — Mycelium

Operating guide for Claude Code (and other agents) working in this repo. Authoritative human
docs: @README.md, @CONTRIBUTING.md, @docs/Doc-Index.md. This file is the short, enforceable
distillation; `CONTRIBUTING.md` wins on any conflict.

## What this repo is
Mycelium is a unified value-semantics substrate (binary/ternary/dense/VSA) with **certified,
never-silent** representation swaps and **honest, per-operation guarantees**. It is in the
**design phase**: the corpus in `docs/` is the product right now; code lands per the phase plan
(see `tools/github/issues.yaml` and the `M-xxx`/`E*` task ids).

## Non-negotiable house rules
1. **The honesty rule.** Every accuracy/guarantee claim is tagged per-model/per-op on the
   lattice `Exact ⊐ Proven ⊐ Empirical ⊐ Declared`. `Proven` is allowed **only** with a theorem
   whose side-conditions are *checked*; otherwise `Empirical` (trials) or `Declared` (asserted,
   always flagged). Downgrade to stay honest; never upgrade without a checked basis (VR-5).
2. **No black boxes.** Selections/conversions/approximations are reified, inspectable, and
   `EXPLAIN`-able. A swap is **never silent**; out-of-range is an explicit `Option`/error.
3. **Append-only decisions.** ADR/RFC/DN status moves forward only
   (`Draft/Proposed → Accepted → Superseded`; notes `→ Resolved`). To change an Accepted
   decision, **supersede** it — don't rewrite history.
4. **Ground every claim.** Normative statements cite their basis (`G1–G11`, tensions `A–E`,
   `R1–R8`, `T0.x–T2.x`) or are marked open questions. No ungrounded "facts".
5. **Small, auditable kernel** (KC-3). SOLID · DRY · KISS · YAGNI · Law of Demeter · SoC;
   composition over inheritance.

## Toolchain
- **Rust** kernel + reference interpreter — MSRV **1.92** pinned; `cargo fmt`, `cargo clippy
  -D warnings`, `cargo test`. MLIR→LLVM is the perf-path AOT; the interpreter is the trusted base.
- **Python 3.13/3.14** via **UV** — `pytest` + codecov, **ruff** + **`ruff format`** (Black-compatible).
- Don't silently bump committed version pins (MSRV, Python) — that's a decision (ADR), not a
  build detail, even if your local toolchain is newer.

## Local checks — run before every commit (local↔CI parity)
One source of truth (`just`); pre-commit and CI route through the same recipes.

```
just            # list recipes
just setup      # best-effort install of the check tools (uv tool / npx / pip)
just check      # run the FULL suite — identical to what CI runs (`just ci`)
just fmt        # auto-format (rust + python)
just hooks      # install the pre-commit hooks
```

Checks **skip gracefully** when a tool or language isn't present yet (most code doesn't exist
yet). Never hand off a red `just check` without explaining the skip.

## Remote CI policy
**No automatic remote CI.** `.github/workflows/checks.yml` is **manual-dispatch only**
(`workflow_dispatch`) and **advisory** (non-blocking) — to keep parity with local while avoiding
surprise Actions cost. It runs the same `just ci`. Do not add `on: push` / `on: pull_request`
auto-triggers without an explicit decision.

## Commits & PRs
- Conventional, imperative subjects referencing the issue/task
  (`docs(rfc-0003): tighten capacity-bound wording`, `feat(swap): …`).
- A PR states which `FR/NFR/VR/SC` it advances (or which ADR/RFC it implements) and **how it was
  verified**. Editorial-only PRs say so.
- Branch from `main`, one task per branch.

## Skills (`.claude/skills/`)
Invoke with `/<name>`; they auto-engage when relevant.
- **`/dev-workflow`** — the implementation discipline above, as a working loop.
- **`/pr-review`** — opinionated PR/diff review (honesty rule, grounding, append-only,
  hallucination pass). Adaptive depth (T0/T1/T2) + `--all` exhaustive mode.
- **`/security-review`** — secrets, supply-chain, shell/CI safety; auto-light on docs-only.
- **`/docs-review`** — cross-refs, notation, grounding labels, status/changelog discipline.
- **`/changelog`** — keep `CHANGELOG.md` + per-doc footers in sync, append-only.

The review skills share one rubric: `.claude/skills/_shared/review-rubric.md` (tiers, severity,
report format). Posture is **advisory** — they recommend, they don't gate.

## Map
- `docs/Mycelium_Project_Foundation.md` — charter (FR/NFR/VR, SC-*/KC-*, ADR-001…009, roadmap).
- `docs/rfcs/`, `docs/adr/`, `docs/notes/` — normative designs, decisions, tradeoff notes.
- `research/` — the evidence base the corpus traces to.
- `tools/github/` — issue/label/milestone bootstrap (`mcp-bootstrap.md`, `gh-bootstrap-local.sh`,
  `issues.yaml`, `idmap.tsv`).
- `justfile`, `.pre-commit-config.yaml`, `scripts/` — the local/CI check tooling.
