This project is in the **design phase**; "changes" here are to the documentation
corpus, not released software. Versioning will begin when the kernel does.

## [Unreleased]

### Added
- **Phase-0 working plan** (`docs/planning/phase-0.md`): the first issue-coupled expansion of
  Foundation §6, mapping the nine Phase-0 tasks (M-001/002/010/011/012/020/090/091/092) to their
  GitHub issues, the critical path, honest KC-1/KC-2 gate status, the proposed canonical
  data-contract schema set, and the author-then-ratify reframing for M-010/M-011 (the
  `docs/spec/` artifacts they ratify do not exist yet).
- Initial **design baseline**: project charter (`docs/Mycelium_Project_Foundation.md`, r3),
  document index (`docs/Doc-Index.md`), five RFCs (RFC-0001…0005, all Accepted),
  ADR-010 (Accepted), design note DN-01 (Resolved), and two research records
  (`research/01`, `research/02`).
- Repository scaffolding: `README.md`, `LICENSE` (MIT), `CONTRIBUTING.md`,
  `.gitignore` (Rust + Python), and index/process READMEs for `docs/adr/` and `docs/rfcs/`.
- **GitHub PM bootstrap** (`tools/github/`): `issues.yaml` / `labels.json` / `milestones.json`,
  the `mcp-bootstrap.md` runner + `gh-bootstrap-local.sh`, the `project-v2-spec.md` board spec,
  and the `idmap.tsv` task→issue map.
- **Agent tooling**: `CLAUDE.md` and `.claude/skills/` (`pr-review`, `security-review`,
  `dev-workflow`, `docs-review`, `changelog`) operationalizing the `CONTRIBUTING.md` house rules.
- **Local check tooling** with local↔CI parity: `justfile` + `scripts/checks/*` (markdownlint,
  offline link/cross-reference, json-schema, codespell, shellcheck, secret scan, fmt/lint),
  `.pre-commit-config.yaml`, and a manual-dispatch **advisory** GitHub Actions workflow.

### Changed (baseline-review consistency pass)
- ADR-001 promoted to firmly **Accepted**; the "no statistical approximation vs
  fully-disclosed approximation" definitional question recorded as **settled**
  (fully-disclosed), consistent with the KC-1 pass and the guarantee lattice.
- Foundation §5.2 core-model sketch marked **superseded by RFC-0001** (packing is
  now schedule-staged, not in the type; guarantee lattice is the four-point form).
- Foundation §5.6 updated: **MLIR→LLVM** recorded as the committed AOT path
  (ADR-007 / RFC-0004), not a candidate.
- Foundation §6 Phase 0 annotated with post-research status (largely complete;
  remaining: the Liquid-Haskell `bundle` probe and the KC-2 LLM-leverage experiment).
- `README.md` decisions table: fixed a placeholder reference for the
  "no implicit conversion" rule (grounded in RFC-0001 §3.3 / FR-M3).
- `docs/Doc-Index.md`: the two research rows now point to the in-repo records.

### Fixed
- Markdown hygiene surfaced by the new check tooling: normalized emphasis to the corpus
  asterisk style and added a missing trailing newline (`README.md`,
  `research/01-prior-art-survey-RECORD.md`, `docs/notes/DN-01-Packing-Placement-Tradeoffs.md`).
- Copilot PR-review findings (PR #1, #42) addressed: corrected the binary↔ternary swap's partial
  right-inverse in RFC-0002 §4 (`dec y = Some x ⟹ enc x = y`; the prior `enc y = …` was a type
  error since `enc : Bin_n → Tern_m`); resolved a P0.3 status contradiction in the Foundation
  Meta section (P0.3 is already resolved per §6); corrected stale references in `tools/github/`
  (`gh-bootstrap.sh`, `docs/planning/*`, `project-v2-spec.md`); `gh-bootstrap-local.sh` now
  honors each milestone's `state` instead of hardcoding `open`.
- Tooling self-lint: `scripts/*` made shellcheck/ruff/markdownlint-clean (cd-failure guards,
  if/then/else over `A && B || C`, split imports, fenced-block spacing).

### Security
- `.gitleaks.toml`: removed an allowlist **regex** (`AKIA[0-9A-Z]{16}`) that exempted the AWS
  access-key-ID *pattern* from scanning — it would have suppressed detection of a real leaked
  key. The path allowlist is retained; pattern-level allowlisting is documented as forbidden.

### Open
- One confirming build: the Liquid-Haskell `bundle` capacity-refinement probe (RFC-0003 §5).
- One existential question: **KC-2 / LLM leverage** (the E4 experiment) — not yet settled.
- Decomposed task/issue set and phase planning documents — *forthcoming* (`docs/planning/`).
