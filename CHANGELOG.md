[Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/). Dates are ISO-8601.

This project is in the **design phase**; "changes" here are to the documentation
corpus, not released software. Versioning will begin when the kernel does.

## [Unreleased]

### Added
- **LSP feedback facade** (`mycelium-lsp::feedback`, **M-140**, Phase 1; FR-S5; Foundation §5.8;
  SC-5): `analyze(node)` exposes the **four** semantic-feedback artifact kinds over one surface —
  (1) typecheck/invariant **diagnostics** (linter), (2) **swap certificates** for statically-
  resolvable swap sites, (3) per-value **bound/guarantee annotations**, (4) **lowering-stage dumps**.
  A failed/unsupported swap is surfaced on the diagnostics channel, never silent. Verified by a
  **scripted-client** integration test driving all four channels (incl. a Proven bound, an
  out-of-range swap, and invariant violations).
- **Canonical formatter** (`mycelium-core::lower::format` + `mycelium-lsp::fmt`, **M-142**, Phase 1;
  RFC-0001 §4.8; ADR-003): a canonical textual normal form that **α-normalizes binder names**
  (`v0, v1, …`), so definitions differing only in names render to identical text and share one
  `content_hash` — reformatting is a projection that never changes content-addressed identity (tested:
  renamed defs format identically and hash equally; formatting leaves identity untouched; free
  variables keep their names).
- **Invariant linter** (`mycelium-lsp::lint`, **M-141**, Phase 1; SC-3; G2; FR-M3; VR-5): static,
  inspectable lints over a Core IR program, emitted as `Diagnostic`s for authoring tools — `implicit-swap`
  (an `Op` mixing paradigms implies a conversion that must be an explicit `Swap`), `unverified-bound`
  (a `Declared` value must always be surfaced, never silently trusted), `placeholder-policy` (a swap
  citing a stub rather than a real `PolicyRef`), and `free-variable` (an open term). Each lint has a
  positive and a negative test. Introduces the toolchain crate `mycelium-lsp` (FR-S5), kept out of
  the auditable kernel (KC-3 — depends on core/interp/cert, nothing depends on it).
- **Inspectable lowering — ≥2 dumpable/diffable stages** (`mycelium-core::lower`, **M-112**, Phase 1;
  RFC-0004 §5/§6; SC-4; WF5): a backend-agnostic lowering pipeline. `stages(node)` returns **`core`**
  (the canonical Core IR tree dump) → **`substrate`** (an A-normal form flattening nested
  `Op`/`Swap`/`Let` to a linear binding list — the pre-codegen shape backends consume), each binding
  whose result repr is statically known (`Const`, `Swap` target) annotated with its **scheduled
  `PhysicalLayout`** (the default schedule, `I2_S` for ternary; RFC-0004 §5 / DN-01). Dumps are
  canonical (deterministic — structurally identical programs render identically, SC-4) and `Meta`
  guarantee tags survive lowering (WF5). `Op`-result layout is left explicitly unannotated (no
  operator typing yet — the omission is honest, not silent; G2).
- **Cleanup / item memory** (`mycelium-vsa::cleanup`, **M-132**, Phase 1; FR-S4; RFC-0003 §3): a
  labelled associative memory (`CleanupMemory`) that snaps a noisy query — an *approximate* `unbind`
  result or a `bundle` decode — to the nearest stored atom by similarity, returning a `Match { label,
  index, confidence, margin }`. The confidence (match cosine) and margin (gap to the runner-up) make
  approximate unbind *usable* and *inspectable* (the retrieval decision is reported, never a hidden
  nearest-neighbour pick; G2). Tested incl. the role⊗filler record-decode use case (bundle two bound
  pairs, unbind by a role, clean up to the right filler).
- **MAP-I bundle capacity bound — `Proven` via checked instantiation** (`mycelium-vsa::capacity`,
  **M-131**, Phase 1; RFC-0003 §5; ADR-010; SC-2; KC-1): `required_dim(m, δ) = ⌈(2/μ²)·ln(m/δ)⌉`
  (μ=0.1) and `proven_capacity_bound` / `MapI::bundle_values_certified`, which attach a **`Proven`**
  `CapacityBound` (basis `ProvenThm`, citing Clarkson-Ubaru-Yang 2023 / Thomas-Dasgupta-Rosing 2021)
  **iff** the checked side-condition `dim ≥ required_dim` holds — exactly the M-001 axiomatized-
  theorem + checked-instantiation pattern (the formula is cited, not re-proven). An undersized
  dimension returns an explicit `InsufficientCapacity` error rather than an unbacked `Proven` tag
  (M-I2/VR-5). `required_dim` reproduces the four M-001 probe settings (1141/1843/2164/2764).
  **Acceptance — ≥10⁴-trial empirical validation (SC-2):** over 10,000 independent trials at
  `dim ≥ required_dim(3, 1e-2)`, the measured nearest-neighbour retrieval-failure rate stays `≤ δ`.
- **VSA submodule — `VsaModel` trait + MAP-I** (`mycelium-vsa`, **M-130**, Phase 1; RFC-0003 §3–§4;
  ADR-008; T2.6): a composition-style `VsaModel` trait (`bind`/`unbind` + self-inverse flag,
  `bundle`, `permute`/`unpermute`, `similarity`, and the honest per-op intrinsic guarantee) and its
  first model **MAP-I** — `bind`/`unbind` are self-inverse and **`Exact`** (elementwise product),
  `permute` is **`Exact`** (cyclic shift), `bundle` is elementwise superposition. Value-level
  adapters for the Exact ops carry honest `Derived` provenance. **Dependency-gated** (ADR-008): the
  crate depends on `mycelium-core` but the kernel does not depend on it — VSA values stay
  type-checkable in the kernel without pulling in this algebra (KC-3). Tests: bind/unbind round-trip
  exactly, permute is invertible/cyclic, a bundle is far more similar to its members than to a
  stranger, dim-mismatch/empty-bundle are explicit errors. The `bundle` **`Proven`** capacity bound
  (M-I2: a *value*-level Proven bound needs a checked basis) is deferred to **M-131** — not stamped
  here (VR-5).
- **Binary↔ternary certified swap** (`mycelium-cert` + `mycelium-core::binary`, **M-120**, Phase 1;
  RFC-0002 §3/§4): `enc`/`dec` per `docs/spec/swaps/binary-ternary.md` over a legal `(n, m)` pair,
  emitting a `SwapCertificate::Bijective` (`LosslessWithinRange`) that references the once-per-pair
  round-trip lemma (`lemma_ref`) bound by concrete `params`. `enc` is total on `B_n`; `dec` is the
  **partial** inverse — a value outside the binary range is an explicit `SwapError::OutOfRange`
  (P4), an illegal pair is a **type error** (`IllegalPair`, RFC-0002 §5), never a `Declared` gamble.
  Within range the result is `Exact`/`bound = None` (P3, M-I1) and records `policy_used` + `Derived`
  provenance. A `BinaryTernarySwapEngine` plugs the swap into the M-110 interpreter. **Acceptance —
  `dec(enc x) = Some x` exhaustively over all 256 bytes** (8↔6, SC-1); serializer output pinned to a
  committed `swap-certificate` example validated against the schema in CI (SC-3). Adds a
  two's-complement codec `mycelium-core::binary` (exhaustively round-trip-tested).
- **Binary↔ternary round-trip proof** (`proofs/binary-ternary-roundtrip/`, **M-121**, Phase 1;
  VR-1/SC-1): the SMT-LIB2 injectivity obligation for the 8↔6 pair — **discharged by Z3 4.16.0
  (`unsat`)**: no two distinct 6-trit vectors collide ⟹ the value map is a bijection onto
  `[−364, 364] ⊇ B_8` ⟹ `dec(enc b) = b` (P1/P2). Wired into `scripts/checks/proofs.sh`
  (skip-graceful without z3); the lemma identity matches `mycelium_cert::roundtrip_lemma_ref()`. P3/P4
  are additionally decided by the M-120 exhaustive Rust corpus. (The fixed `8↔6` instance; a
  width-generic proof is future work — each legal pair gets its own discharged lemma.)
- **Balanced-ternary arithmetic** (`mycelium-core::ternary` + `mycelium-interp`, **M-111**, Phase 1;
  FR-M2): the single home for the balanced-ternary integer codec (`int ↔ trits`, MSB-first, the
  §3.1 digit-extraction algorithm) and fixed-width digit-wise arithmetic — `neg` (digit-wise sign
  flip = value negation), ripple-carry `add`/`sub`, and shifted-add `mul`. Out-of-range results are
  an explicit `None`/`EvalError::Overflow`, **never** a silent wrap (SC-3). The interpreter gains
  `trit.neg/add/sub/mul` primitives over it. **Acceptance — property-tested vs an `i64` oracle by
  exhaustion** over all operand pairs at widths `m ≤ 4` (and the codec round-trip/neg at `m ≤ 5`):
  in range the digit-wise result equals the encoded integer result, out of range it overflows.
  Grounded in `docs/spec/swaps/binary-ternary.md` §1/§3.1; reused by the M-120 swap.
- **Reference interpreter** (`mycelium-interp`, **M-110**, Phase 1): the trusted, executable
  **small-step operational semantics** for the Core IR, closing SPEC §10.3 (RFC-0004 §2; ADR-009;
  NFR-7). Call-by-value substitution over closed `Node`s with the rules E-Let-Bind/Step,
  E-Op-Arg/Apply, E-Swap-Arg/Apply (documented in the crate). An extensible **primitive registry**
  (`PrimRegistry`) ships the exact elementwise built-ins (`core.id`, `bit.not/and/or/xor`,
  `trit.neg`); a **`SwapEngine`** hook ships the trivial same-`Repr` `IdentitySwapEngine`. Results
  thread metadata honestly — guarantee by `meet` (RFC-0001 §4.7), provenance `Derived{op, inputs}`
  over content hashes (§4.6), `policy_used` on swaps. **Never silent**: free variables, unknown/
  ill-typed prims, unsupported cross-paradigm swaps, approximate-input composition (no bound kernel
  yet — ADR-010/E2-4), and fuel exhaustion are all explicit `EvalError`s. 20-case golden corpus.
  Adds `mycelium_core::operation_hash` (provenance op identity for prims). Scope boundary:
  balanced-ternary arithmetic + oracle property tests are **M-111**; the certified binary↔ternary
  swap + proof are **M-120/M-121**.
- **Guarantee `meet`-composition** (`mycelium-core::guarantee`, **M-102**, Phase 1):
  `GuaranteeStrength::meet` (the weakest-wins greatest-lower-bound) plus `propagate`/`meet_all` for
  the RFC-0001 §4.7 rule `guarantee(result) = meet(inputs…, g_f)`, and `TOP`/`ALL` constants. The
  meet-semilattice laws — commutativity, associativity, idempotence, identity `Exact`, `Declared`
  absorbing — are verified by **exhaustion** over all 4×4(×4) tuples (complete for the finite
  lattice, not sampled). Honesty can only degrade, never spuriously upgrade (VR-3/VR-5).
- **Content-addressing** (`mycelium-core::content`, **M-103**, Phase 1): `Node::content_hash` /
  `Value::content_hash` — a BLAKE3 hash over an injective, domain-separated, length-prefixed
  encoding of the *identity-bearing* content: the α-normalized structure (bound vars as de Bruijn
  indices, binder names dropped), types-with-`Repr`, constant literals, operator names, and swap
  target+policy. Dynamic `Meta` (provenance, bounds, sparsity, `policy_used`) is excluded. Adds a
  separable `hash ↔ name` table (`Names`) for names-as-metadata, `ScalarKind::tag`, and
  `ContentHash::from_parts`/`algo`/`digest`. Acceptance met: identical defs collide; trivial (α)
  renames don't change identity; a paradigm/precision/literal/operator change does (RFC-0001 §4.6;
  ADR-003).
- **Core IR (de)serialization** (`mycelium-core`, **M-104**, Phase 1): `serde`
  `Serialize`/`Deserialize` for `Value`/`Meta`/`Repr`/`Bound`/`Provenance`/… emitting *exactly* the
  ratified JSON data contracts (`kind`/`class`/`layout` tags; `VSA`/`BF16`/`TL1`/`TL2` renames;
  `payload` as `{bits|trits|scalars|hypervector}` with MSB-first bit/trit strings; `bound` modelled
  by presence; flat `kind`+`basis` `Bound`). `Deserialize` routes `Value`/`Meta` through their
  checked constructors, so M-I1…M-I4 and payload↔repr mismatches are rejected on the wire — never
  silently accepted. Faithful round-trip (`deserialize(serialize(v)) == v` incl. `Meta`) is tested
  over a corpus spanning all four paradigms × every guarantee/bound/basis/layout; serializer output
  is pinned to three new committed `value` examples (ternary/dense/vsa) that `scripts/checks/schema.sh`
  validates against `value.schema.json` in CI (RFC-0001 §4.8).
- **Core IR data structures** (`mycelium-core`, **M-101**, Phase 1): Rust types mirroring the
  ratified schemas — `Repr`/`ScalarKind`/`SparsityClass`, the `GuaranteeStrength` lattice,
  `Bound`/`BoundBasis`/`BoundKind`/`NormKind` (ADR-011: `basis` universal), `Meta` (with
  `Provenance`, `SparsityObs`, `PhysicalLayout`/`PackScheme`), `Value`/`Payload`, `ContentHash`,
  and the `Node` grammar (closes the core of SPEC §10.2; RFC-0001 §4.5). The honesty invariants
  **M-I1…M-I4** and payload↔repr/repr well-formedness are enforced **by construction**
  (`Meta::new`, `Value::new` → `WfError`). 17 unit tests; `fmt`/`clippy -D warnings`/`test` green on
  MSRV 1.92.
- **Minimal surface-syntax fragment** (`experiments/surface-fragment/`, **M-020**): a throwaway,
  experiment-only concrete syntax (EBNF + desugaring to the Core IR nodes + 3 reference programs:
  swap round-trip, VSA `bundle`, and a no-implicit-conversion type-error) to feed the KC-2
  experiment. **Not** a committed surface — gated on KC-2 (hence under `experiments/`, not
  `docs/spec/`). Linked from `SPECIFICATION.md` §10.1.
- **Binary↔ternary encoding spec** (`docs/spec/swaps/binary-ternary.md`, **M-012**): precise
  `enc`/`dec` for the canonical `8↔6` width — balanced-ternary digit semantics, the legality
  condition `B_n ⊆ T_m`, `LosslessWithinRange` with an `Option`-typed (never-silent) inverse, the
  four M-121 correctness obligations, and a worked round-trip + out-of-range example (RFC-0002
  §4/§5; T2.1). Linked from `SPECIFICATION.md` §6/§10.4.
- **Python tooling skeleton** (`experiments/`, **M-092**): a UV-managed project targeting
  **Python 3.13** (ADR-007) with a `dev` group (pytest, pytest-cov, ruff, black), a trivial
  importable module + passing smoke test, and a committed `uv.lock`. `scripts/checks/test.sh` runs
  it via `uv run --frozen pytest` under the pinned interpreter, so it joins the `just check`/CI
  suite (skip-graceful when uv is absent).
- **Rust workspace skeleton** (**M-091**): a 6-crate Cargo workspace (`mycelium-core`,
  `mycelium-interp`, `mycelium-vsa`, `mycelium-mlir` stub, `mycelium-cert` stub, `xtask`) with
  **MSRV pinned to 1.92** via `rust-toolchain.toml` + `rust-version` (ADR-007), workspace lints
  (`unsafe_code = forbid`, clippy warn), and a smoke test per crate. `cargo fmt --check`,
  `clippy -D warnings`, and `cargo test` are all green on 1.92. Adds `scripts/checks/test.sh` +
  `just test`, wired into the `just check`/CI suite (skip-graceful when a toolchain is absent), so
  test parity now holds local↔CI. Fixes a malformed `Cargo.lock` line in `.gitignore`.
- **M-001 probe scaffold** (`proofs/lh-bundle/`): the Liquid-Haskell MAP-I `bundle`
  capacity-refinement module + cabal project + writeup, encoding the axiomatized-theorem +
  checked-instantiation strategy with ≥3 concrete `(d,m,δ)` settings (RFC-0003 §5; T0.2). **Not yet
  discharged** — no GHC/LH/Z3 in this environment — so KC-1 stays `passed (literature)`; the
  derivation table is the independently-checkable artifact. Establishes `proofs/<name>/` as the
  home for machine-checkable proofs (resolves OQ-2).
- **`SPECIFICATION.md` skeleton** (`docs/spec/SPECIFICATION.md`, **M-011**): the consolidation index
  over the corpus — §1–§9 reconciled to RFC-0001 (r2)/RFC-0002…0005/ADR-010/011/DN-01 and pointed at
  the ratified `docs/spec/schemas/` contracts; §10 enumerates the open build items, each linked to a
  live issue (no floating TODOs). Status `consolidating-draft → ratified-skeleton`.
- **ADR-011 — `BoundBasis` is a property of every `Bound`** (`docs/adr/ADR-011-...md`, Accepted):
  formally supersedes the implicit RFC-0001 r1 §4.3 decision that scoped `basis` to `CapacityBound`
  only, so every approximate value (ε, δ, crosstalk, capacity) honestly records how its bound was
  obtained (VR-5, G5). Resolves OQ-3.
- **Core data-contract schemas** (`docs/spec/schemas/`, **M-010**): the 10 ratified JSON Schemas
  (draft 2020-12) — `repr`, `value`, `meta`, `guarantee`, `bound`, `provenance`,
  `physical-layout`, `swap-certificate`, `policy`, `reconstruction-manifest` — each a faithful
  projection of its source RFC/ADR section, plus ≥1 valid and ≥1 invalid example per schema (the
  invalids exercise the honesty-load-bearing invariants M-I1/M-I4). `just schema` validates the
  set in CI. The OQ-3/OQ-4/OQ-5 clarifications surfaced here are now resolved (see below /
  `docs/spec/schemas/README.md`).
- **Phase-0 working plan** (`docs/planning/phase-0.md`): the first issue-coupled expansion of
  Foundation §6, mapping the nine Phase-0 tasks (M-001/002/010/011/012/020/090/091/092) to their
  GitHub issues, the critical path, honest KC-1/KC-2 gate status, the proposed canonical
  data-contract schema set, and the author-then-ratify reframing for M-010/M-011 (the
  `docs/spec/` artifacts they ratify do not exist yet).
- Initial **design baseline**: project charter (`docs/Mycelium_Project_Foundation.md`, r3),
  document index (`docs/Doc-Index.md`), five RFCs (RFC-0001…0005, all Accepted),
  ADR-010 (Accepted), design note DN-01 (Resolved), and two research records
  (`research/01`, `research/02`).
- Repository scaffolding: `README.md`, `LICENSE` (MIT), `CONTRIBUTING.md`,
  `.gitignore` (Rust + Python), and index/process READMEs for `docs/adr/` and `docs/rfcs/`.
- **GitHub PM bootstrap** (`tools/github/`): `issues.yaml` / `labels.json` / `milestones.json`,
  the `mcp-bootstrap.md` runner + `gh-bootstrap-local.sh`, the `project-v2-spec.md` board spec,
  and the `idmap.tsv` task→issue map.
- **Agent tooling**: `CLAUDE.md` and `.claude/skills/` (`pr-review`, `security-review`,
  `dev-workflow`, `docs-review`, `changelog`) operationalizing the `CONTRIBUTING.md` house rules.
- **Local check tooling** with local↔CI parity: `justfile` + `scripts/checks/*` (markdownlint,
  offline link/cross-reference, json-schema, codespell, shellcheck, secret scan, fmt/lint),
  `.pre-commit-config.yaml`, and a manual-dispatch **advisory** GitHub Actions workflow.

### Changed
- **Proofs wired into the check suite** (`scripts/checks/proofs.sh` + `just proofs`): runs the
  LiquidHaskell `bundle` probe (`LC_ALL=C.UTF-8 cabal build`, a green build ⟺ LH `SAFE`),
  skip-graceful when GHC/cabal/z3 are absent. Added to `just check`/`just ci`; the manual-dispatch CI
  workflow now sets up GHC 9.8.2 + cabal + z3 (with a cabal/dist-newstyle cache) so the proof
  verifies on a manual run. (Whole suite remains `workflow_dispatch`-only.)
- **KC-1 confirmed (build)** (**M-001**): the Liquid-Haskell MAP-I `bundle` capacity refinement
  (`proofs/lh-bundle/`) type-checks **`SAFE` (16 constraints)** and Z3 discharged all four `(d,m,δ)`
  instantiations (GHC 9.8.2 · LiquidHaskell 0.9.8.2 · Z3 4.8.12), ratifying the axiomatized-theorem +
  checked-instantiation strategy (RFC-0003 §5; ADR-010). KC-1 moves `passed (literature) → confirmed
  (build)` in the Foundation §2.4 and Doc-Index §3/§4. (The Clarkson/Thomas theorem remains cited,
  not re-proven — by design.) Haskell build output (`dist-newstyle/`, `.liquid/`) gitignored;
  codespell skips them.
- **Docs/parity CI hardened** (`.github/workflows/checks.yml`, **M-090**): the manual-dispatch
  advisory workflow now sets up **uv** (so the `experiments/` Python 3.13 tests actually run) and
  **Rust** (pinned via `rust-toolchain.toml`, so fmt/clippy/test run), and adds an advisory
  **Codecov** upload of the experiments coverage. Markdown-lint + offline link-check + schema
  validation already covered `docs/**` and the schemas via `just ci`; the PR template was already
  wired. Posture unchanged: `workflow_dispatch` only, non-blocking (no auto-triggers — CLAUDE.md).
- **RFC-0001 → r2** (status stays Accepted): §4.3 `Bound` grammar revised per **ADR-011** —
  `BoundBasis` factored out to a required companion of *every* `Bound` (was: `CapacityBound` only),
  and `NormKind` enumerated `L1|L2|Linf|Rel` as an extensible registry (resolves OQ-4). The r1 §4.3
  grammar is formally superseded; indexes (`Doc-Index.md`, `docs/rfcs/README.md`,
  `docs/adr/README.md`) and the `bound` schema updated to match.

### Changed (baseline-review consistency pass)
- ADR-001 promoted to firmly **Accepted**; the "no statistical approximation vs
  fully-disclosed approximation" definitional question recorded as **settled**
  (fully-disclosed), consistent with the KC-1 pass and the guarantee lattice.
- Foundation §5.2 core-model sketch marked **superseded by RFC-0001** (packing is
  now schedule-staged, not in the type; guarantee lattice is the four-point form).
- Foundation §5.6 updated: **MLIR→LLVM** recorded as the committed AOT path
  (ADR-007 / RFC-0004), not a candidate.
- Foundation §6 Phase 0 annotated with post-research status (largely complete;
  remaining: the Liquid-Haskell `bundle` probe and the KC-2 LLM-leverage experiment).
- `README.md` decisions table: fixed a placeholder reference for the
  "no implicit conversion" rule (grounded in RFC-0001 §3.3 / FR-M3).
- `docs/Doc-Index.md`: the two research rows now point to the in-repo records.

### Fixed
- Markdown hygiene surfaced by the new check tooling: normalized emphasis to the corpus
  asterisk style and added a missing trailing newline (`README.md`,
  `research/01-prior-art-survey-RECORD.md`, `docs/notes/DN-01-Packing-Placement-Tradeoffs.md`).
- Copilot PR-review findings (PR #1, #42) addressed: corrected the binary↔ternary swap's partial
  right-inverse in RFC-0002 §4 (`dec y = Some x ⟹ enc x = y`; the prior `enc y = …` was a type
  error since `enc : Bin_n → Tern_m`); resolved a P0.3 status contradiction in the Foundation
  Meta section (P0.3 is already resolved per §6); corrected stale references in `tools/github/`
  (`gh-bootstrap.sh`, `docs/planning/*`, `project-v2-spec.md`); `gh-bootstrap-local.sh` now
  honors each milestone's `state` instead of hardcoding `open`.
- Tooling self-lint: `scripts/*` made shellcheck/ruff/markdownlint-clean (cd-failure guards,
  if/then/else over `A && B || C`, split imports, fenced-block spacing).

### Security
- `.gitleaks.toml`: removed an allowlist **regex** (`AKIA[0-9A-Z]{16}`) that exempted the AWS
  access-key-ID *pattern* from scanning — it would have suppressed detection of a real leaked
  key. The path allowlist is retained; pattern-level allowlisting is documented as forbidden.

### Open
- One confirming build: the Liquid-Haskell `bundle` capacity-refinement probe (RFC-0003 §5).
- One existential question: **KC-2 / LLM leverage** (the E4 experiment) — not yet settled.
- Decomposed task/issue set and phase planning documents — *forthcoming* (`docs/planning/`).
